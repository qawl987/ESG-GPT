<P>Apple’s 2022 ESG Report3</P>
<H1>At Apple, we believe the measure of any great innovation is thepositive impact it has on people’s lives. It’s why we work everyday to make our technology an even greater force for good.</H1>
<P>Today, our teams around the world infuse Apple’s deeply held values into everything we make. That work cantake many forms. But whether we’re protecting the right to privacy, designing technology that is accessible toall, or using more recycled material in our products than ever, we are always working to make a difference forthe people we serve and the planet we inhabit.</P>
<P>As a company, we know that our impact on people’s lives reaches beyond the technology we create. And weapply the same ethos of constant innovation and improvement to every aspect of our work — from building aninclusive company culture where everyone feels welcome to becoming carbon neutral across our global supplychain and the lifetime of our products by 2030.</P>
<P>At the heart of our efforts is a steadfast commitment to serving the communities we are a part of. We workwith teachers, advocates, and entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds as part of our Racial Equity and JusticeInitiative. We help create opportunity in communities on the frontlines of climate change through the RestoreFund, which supports carbon removal and sustainable forestry. And we provide resources and training tothe next generation of innovators through the Apple Developer Academy and educational initiatives acrossthe globe.</P>
<P>In this report, we are pleased to share our progress, which is a product of collaboration with committedpartners worldwide. At Apple, we believe that the only way to effectively tackle global challenges is byworking together, and we are grateful to share this road with so many passionate leaders.</P>
<P>We’re engaged in this work because it’s right — and because we want to leave the world better than wefound it in everything we do. By leading with our values, we hope to be a ripple in the pond that inspiresa far greater change.</P>

<P>In fiscal year 2021, our environmentalinitiatives avoided over 23 million metrictons of emissions across all scopes, andwe reduced our carbon footprint by</P>
<P>40 percent compared with fiscal year2015. Efforts and initiatives that we’vebeen growing for years made this possible— like sourcing 100 percent renewableelectricity for our facilities, transitioningsuppliers to clean energy, and usinglow-carbon materials in products.</P>

<H1>Our approach</H1>
<H3>Our values flow through the technology we make, the waywe make it, and how we care for people and the planet weshare. These values — accessibility, education, environment,inclusion and diversity, privacy, and supplier responsibility— are central to our ESG approach. And we go further toaddress a comprehensive set of critical issues that matterto our company and to our stakeholders.</H3>
<P>From our commitment to human rights to our 2030 environmental goals, ESGtopics are deeply interconnected. We can make the biggest impact only whenwe understand how these issues relate to one another.</P>
<P>ESG priorities are managed across Apple, and our senior leaders play an importantrole in integrating ESG into functions across the company. We listen to stakeholders— including our people, suppliers, communities, shareholders, and other externalgroups — to understand the issues they care about. And we measure our ESGprogress across our business so that we can work toward being more transparentwith each year.</P>
<P>Above all, we’re always working to leave the world better than we found it,and to create powerful tools that empower others to do the same.</P>
<H2>Environment</H2>
<P>We’ve been carbon neutral for our ownoperations since 2020, including business traveland employee commute, and are progressingtoward an urgent goal to be carbon neutralacross our entire business — including the fulllife cycle of our products — by 2030. We’reon an ambitious journey to one day make ourproducts using only recycled or renewablematerials. We design our products to be safe foranyone who assembles, uses, or recycles them— and to be better for the environment. At thesame time, we’re partnering with communitiesand local leaders and working to make sure ourenvironmental efforts are also a force for equityand justice.</P>

<H1>Advocating for change</H1>
<P>We’re committed to helpingaddress shared global challenges.That’s why we engage with publicpolicy and the legal system whenwe identify an opportunity tosupport the rights and well-beingof our people, customers,communities, and planet.</P>
<H2>Advocating for strong climate policies</H2>
<P>Apple’s climate policy advocacy centers onseveral principles, each of which governApple’s public policy positions on climate:Set strong targets based on science; disclosecomprehensive emissions; create sector-specific policies; and support a greeneconomy for all.</P>
<P>In April 2021, we made a public statementcalling for mandatory disclosures of globalgreenhouse gases across all emissions scopes.The statement also focused the discussionwithin industry and government towardgreater transparency and increased attentionby regulators.</P>
<P>In May 2021, Apple also became one of the firstcompanies to voice support for the enactmentof the Clean Energy Standard (CES) that woulddecarbonize the power grid by 2035. And atthe 26th UN Climate Change Conference ofthe Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland,in 2021, Apple called for bold governmentaction on climate change, joining several newinitiatives, including the First Movers Coalition,the Forest Investor Club, and the Clean EnergyDemand Initiative.</P>
<P>We also advocate for country-specific measuresthat motivate climate action. For example,we’ve called for enhanced climate ambitionand renewable energy deployment in Japan’sBasic Energy Plan and Nationally DeterminedContribution (Japan’s plan to reduce emissionsin furtherance of the Paris Agreement), and for</P>

<P>decarbonization policies to prioritize supportfor new technologies that can fully account forreducing emissions across their life cycle.</P>
<H2>Speaking out for rights</H2>
<P><Span>We believe that every person should be treated</Span>
<Span>with dignity and respect, and we speak out</Span>
<Span>publicly in ways that reflect our values. As</Span>
<Span>just one recent example, we’ve continued</Span>
<Span>our public support for LGBTQ+ equality by</Span>
<Span>working with The Human Rights Campaign</Span>
<Span>and other organizations to support LGBTQ+</Span>
<Span>equality protections and oppose discriminatory</Span>
<Span>proposals. This includes legislative advocacy</Span>
<Span>at the federal and state levels, and working</Span>
<Span>with coalitions of businesses to stand against</Span>
<Span>what we believe to be harmful and divisive</Span>
<Span>legislation that threatens individuals, families,</Span>
<Span>and communities. Most recently, that included</Span>
<Span>sending a letter to Texas leadership opposing</Span>
<Span>laws that discriminate against the LGBTQ+</Span>
<Span>community.</Span>

<H2>Protecting our customers</H2>
<P><Span>In the U.S., the legal system is one avenue</Span>
<Span>through which Apple can take action to support</Span>
<Span>our values. For example, in January 2022,</Span>
<Span>Apple, along with other leading companies,</Span>
<Span>filed an</Span>
<Span><Link>amicus brief</Link>
<Figure><ImageData src="images\4. Apple 2022 ESG Report_img_66.jpg"/>

</Span>
<Span>in support of the EPA’s</Span>
<Span>authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions</Span>
<Span>because that authority “is critical to combatting</Span>
<Span>climate change.”</Span>
</P>
<P>In November 2021, Apple filed a lawsuit againstNSO Group and its parent company to hold itaccountable for the surveillance and targetingof Apple users. The complaint provides newinformation on how NSO Group infected victims’devices with its Pegasus spyware. To preventfurther abuse and harm to its users, Apple isseeking a permanent injunction to ban NSOGroup from using any Apple software, services,or devices.</P>

<P>Apple’s 2022 ESG Report13</P>
<P>At Apple, we’re acting with urgency to protect our planet’s limited resources and to bea leader in the fight against climate change. Since 2020, we’ve been carbon neutral forour worldwide operations, and by 2030, we plan to expand that progress to our entiresupply chain and the lifetime use of our products. And today, nearly 20 percent of thematerials in our products were made from recycled content — a number we’re workingto increase.</P>
<P>Across our environmental work, we’re also committed to being a force for equity. We’reworking with communities on the frontlines of climate change and the next generationof diverse entrepreneurs to create shared opportunity and to build a more just world.</P>
<H1>Our approach</H1>
<P>The environmental challenges we face todayare significant, and we’re responding withurgency and dedication. We approach our workby focusing on fundamental questions. Whatmatters most? And where can we make thegreatest impact? These questions guide ourwork across our strategic focus areas of climatechange, resources, and smarter chemistry</P>
<P>— and inform our goals in how we can bestachieve change.</P>

<Span>how we’re progressing toward our goals.</Span>
</P>
<P>We know we’re not alone in working to reduceour environmental footprint. So we’re engagingwith others to support our efforts and findopportunities to lift local communities alongthe way.</P>
<P>Setting ambitious goals is essential to ourapproach — to drive the innovation andcollaboration that makes change possibleand to be transparent and accountable toour progress.</P>
<P>Our work is led by Lisa Jackson, Apple’s VicePresident of Environment, Policy and SocialInitiatives, reporting directly to CEO TimCook. The Environment, Policy and SocialInitiatives team works with other teams acrossApple to set strategy, engage stakeholders,and communicate progress. Our integratedapproach means that decisions about theenvironment are reviewed and supportedat the highest levels of the company.</P>
<H1>Climate change</H1>
<P><Span>As a global business, we believe it is our</Span>
<Span>responsibility to take strong, decisive, and</Span>
<Span>inclusive steps to mitigate our climate impact.</Span>
<Span>We’ve committed to achieving carbon neutrality</Span>
<Span>— reducing emissions 75 percent compared</Span>
<Span>with fiscal year 2015 and balancing the residual</Span>
<Span>emissions with carbon removal — across the</Span>

<H2>Low-carbon design</H2>
<P>To reduce the carbon footprint of our products,we’re increasing efficiency and transitioningto materials from recycled sources and thosemade using low-carbon energy. In 2021, wecontinued to improve the carbon efficiency ofthe integrated circuits we use in our products— components we’ve prioritized because theyare carbon-intensive. For example, switchingto the Apple M1 chip for the 13-inch MacBookPro reduced the energy needed to manufactureand use the device, driving down the product’scarbon footprint by over 8 percent.</P>
<P>We’ve continued to expand our use of</P>
<P>100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosuresof a number of products. All iPad models in ourlineup now use 100 percent recycled aluminumin their enclosures — joining Apple WatchSeries 7, Apple Watch SE, MacBook Air, Macmini, and the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Prodevices. For products released in 2021 that hadenclosures made with primary aluminum, we</P>
<Figure><ImageData src="images\4. Apple 2022 ESG Report_img_79.jpg"/>

<P>To minimize the carbon footprint of our products, we seek to create less waste in the processing of materials,reduce machining time and the associated energy used, more efficiently transform material into the shapeswe need, and maximize recovery and reprocessing of manufacturing scrap.</P>
<P>prioritized the use of aluminum smelted usinglow-carbon sources of electricity rather thanfossil fuels — for a lower carbon impact. Thesechanges alone have decreased the carbonemissions associated with our use of aluminumby 68 percent since 2015.</P>
<P><Span>Product energy use accounts for 22 percent</Span>
<Span>of our gross carbon footprint — and has an</Span>
<Span>impact on the individual energy use of each</Span>
<Span>of our customers. By addressing this in the</Span>

<H2>Energy efficiency</H2>
<P>We’re focused on using less energy acrossour operations, beginning with how we design,operate, and maintain our facilities. And wecontinue these same efforts into our supplychain, which benefits the communities whereour suppliers operate. Drawing less energy fromelectrical grids — many of which still rely heavilyon fossil fuels — helps reduce local air pollutionand improve air quality for nearby communities.</P>
<P>The emissions from manufacturing our productsaccount for about 70 percent of Apple’s grosscarbon footprint. We launched our Supplier EnergyEfficiency Program in 2015 with the goal of helpingsuppliers optimize their facilities and operationsto use as little energy as possible. We provideguidance designed to help suppliers uncoveropportunities for energy efficiency. Suppliers inour Supplier Energy Efficiency Program avoidedmore than 1,150,000 annualized metric tons ofsupply chain carbon emissions in fiscal year 2021.</P>

<H1>Apple’scomprehensivecarbon footprint</H1>
<P>This past year we intensified our efforts to reduce Apple’semissions. In fiscal year 2021, we avoided over 23 millionmetric tons of emissions across all scopes. Initiatives thatwe’ve been growing for years — like sourcing 100 percentrenewable electricity for our facilities, transitioning suppliersto clean energy, and using low-carbon materials in products— yielded indisputable results.</P>
<P>Thanks to this work, we’ve begun to decouple businessgrowth from emissions: While our revenue grew 33 percent,our emissions grew by less than 5 percent. To mitigate thisincrease in emissions, we applied an additional 0.6 milliontons of renewable energy credits (RECs) and 0.5 millionmetric tons of carbon offsets to proportionally coverelectricity use and direct emissions, respectively, across ourvalue chain. This represents a short-term bridging solutionas we grow our carbon reduction programs to meet thescale of the challenge.</P>

<H1>Providing access to clean energy in South Africa</H1>
<P>Even a few years ago, not everyone in one community in South Africa had electricityat home. Many people had been using battery-powered lanterns because upfront costsand other challenges put connecting to the grid out of reach. As we worked with ourpartners to identify new renewable energy projects for our Power for Impact program,we saw exciting potential in this community.</P>
<P>Our partner on the ground, DC GO, a solar energy provider based in Johannesburg,got to work meeting members of the community and learning more about their needs.Ultimately, DC GO developed a pay-as-you-go model that brought solar energy to 3500homes that previously lacked access. This was possible only because of the way theybuilt relationships with community members and worked with Apple to price the solutionin line with what people were already spending on batteries for their lanterns.</P>
<P>In addition, DC GO hired and trained local people for jobs in sales, maintenance,and other roles that not only created local jobs but also helped to make sure the project— and the community’s access to electricity — would be sustainable over time.</P>
<P><Span>This is just one example of how the Power for Impact program is working to benefit</Span>
<Span>communities, our company, and the environment at the same time. Learn more</Span>

<P>With access to electricity in their homes, kids can now do homeworkat night and families can cook meals indoors.</P>
<H1>Renewable electricity</H1>
<P>Our retail stores, data centers, and officesaround the world currently source 100 percentrenewable electricity. We’ve focused ourefforts to source renewables around severalkey pillars: creating new renewable energyprojects, undertaking projects that deliver clearbenefits to local communities, and supportingrenewable energy innovations. About 1.5gigawatts of Apple-created renewableelectricity projects account for over 90 percentof the renewable electricity our facilities use.</P>
<P>We continue to experience tremendousprogress toward our goal of transitioning ourmanufacturing supply chain to 100 percentrenewable electricity by 2030. As of March2022, 213 manufacturing partners in 25countries have committed to 100 percentrenewable energy for Apple production.</P>
<P>Over 70 percent of companies on Apple’sSupplier List — those suppliers that makeup 98 percent of Apple’s direct spend formaterials, manufacturing, and assembly ofour products worldwide — have committed to100 percent renewable electricity. In addition,many other smaller suppliers have also madethese commitments.</P>
<H1>Direct emissions abatement</H1>
<P>To address the non-electricity emissionsassociated with our materials andmanufacturing processes, we seektechnological solutions through emissionsabatement or switching to low-carbon fueloptions. For example, we partnered withaluminum companies and the governmentsof Canada and Quebec to help fund researchand development for ELYSIS, a technology thateliminates direct greenhouse gas emissionsfrom aluminum smelting.</P>
<P>Many components essential to products likeours, including integrated circuit chips anddisplay panels, currently rely on manufacturingprocesses that use fluorinated gases, whichhave high global warming potential. We’repartnering closely with key manufacturersto prevent these gases from being</P>
<P>released into the atmosphere by optimizingmanufacturing processes and deployingabatement technologies.</P>
<P>To address emissions from shipping productsto our customers, we’re shifting wheneverpossible toward less carbon-intensive shippingmodes, such as rail and ocean. And we’reseeking out technical innovations, includingalternative fuels and electric vehicles. In fiscalyear 2021, Apple avoided 180,000 metric tonsof CO2e by shifting the mode of transport and</P>
<P>reducing product weight through the removalof the power adapter from the box ofiPhone devices.</P>

<H1>Climate scenario analysis</H1>
<P>In 2020, we conducted a climate scenario analysis to help us better understand the potential physical andtransition effects of climate change. To align with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures(TCFD) recommendations, we considered a range of future scenarios, including a scenario below 2°C.And we assessed geographies around the world to capture both corporate and supplier activities. Theanalysis highlighted how our renewable energy program and carbon neutrality goals could contribute to ourcorporate resiliency. It also provided environmental data that we considered in developing business strategies,including considerations around supply chain diversification, as well as safeguarding our global assets.</P>
<P>We’re committed to managing regulatory, reputational, and market risks related to climate change.For more information on these climate-related risks and Apple’s governance of these risks, read our2021 CDP submission (PDF).</P>

<H1>Carbon removal</H1>
<P>To address the emissions we can’t yet avoid,we’re are investing in carbon removal projects.In addition to removing carbon, nature-basedcarbon removal projects also offer importantecological and social benefits, such as preservingbiodiversity and enhancing the resilience ofecosystems, while often providing economicdevelopment opportunities for local communities.</P>
<P>We partnered with Conservation Internationaland Goldman Sachs to launch the innovativeRestore Fund, which seeks to blend responsibleforestry practices with carbon removal: We’reworking with forestry managers to createsustainably managed forests that optimize forboth carbon and wood production, creatingrevenue from timber, and generating high-quality carbon credits. Apple will invest up to$200 million in projects that aim to removecarbon from the atmosphere and store it, allwhile meeting clear social and environmentalimpact criteria and offering a financial return.In its pilot phase, the Restore Fund has a goalof removing at least 1 million metric tons ofcarbon dioxide per year.</P>
<P><Span>As the projects in the Restore Fund come</Span>
<Span>online, we’re also working to address difficult</Span>

<H3>Welcoming the first class of the Impact Accelerator</H3>
<P><Span>Last year, we welcomed the first class to our Impact Accelerator, a program for Black-</Span>
<Span>,Hispanic/Latinx-, and Indigenous-owned businesses headquartered in the United States</Span>
<Span>that share our focus on innovation and our commitment to the environment. Part of Apple’s</Span>
<Span>Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (see</Span>
<Span><Link>page 60</Link>
<Figure><ImageData src="images\4. Apple 2022 ESG Report_img_99.jpg"/>
</Figure>
</Span>
<Span>), the Accelerator aims to help combat</Span>
<Span>systemic barriers to opportunity, while also advancing innovative solutions for communities</Span>
<Span>most impacted by climate change.</Span>
</P>
<P>We selected our first class of 15 businesses on the cutting edge of green technology andclean energy to begin the program in August 2021. The three-month program included livevirtual sessions, online courses on supply chain management, supplier diversity, financialand legal subjects, as well as one-on-one mentorship with an Apple expert on topics fromrenewable energy to responsible sourcing.</P>
<P>The goal of the Impact Accelerator is to better position the participating companies forgrowth, to improve their abilities to take on larger contracts, and to expand their customerbase — all while fostering their environmental commitment. For example, last October weannounced that we will be working with the Oceti Sakowin Power Authority, formed by sixSioux tribes to jointly develop tribal renewable energy resources, on a project to createa wind power development in the Midwest. And following the success of this year’s class,our efforts continue. This spring, applications opened for the next class to join ourImpact Accelerator.</P>

<H2>Resources</H2>
<P>Natural resources make our work possible —and we take responsibility for how we source,use, and recycle the materials we rely on tocreate our products. As a starting point, thismeans sourcing responsibly, minimizing ourfreshwater use, and eliminating waste acrossour operations and those of our suppliers.And we’re also seeking to redefine the overallresource footprint of our products. Our goal isto one day make products using only responsiblysourced recycled and renewable materials.</P>
<P>Within resources, we focus on three mainareas of impact:</P>
<P>•Materials:Transitioning to only recycledor renewable materials in our productsand packaging, and maximizing materialefficiency, product longevity, and recovery.</P>
<P>•Water:Reducing water impacts in themanufacturing of our products, use of ourservices, and operation of our facilities.At the same time, transitioning to alternativesources, improving the quality of waterwe discharge, and protecting sharedwater resources.</P>
<P>•Zero waste:Minimizing overall wastegenerated and eliminating waste sent tolandfill from our manufacturing supply chainas well as corporate offices, data centers,and retail stores.</P>
<H3>Materials</H3>
<P>We aim to make the best use of the materials werely on to make our products. That’s why we’refocusing on three different levers to reduceour footprint and achieve circularity: sourcingand efficiency; product longevity; and productend-of-life.</P>
<P>Sourcing and efficiency</P>
<P>Last year, we made progress across materials —from expanding our use of recycled rare earthelements to designing cameras with recycledgold. In September, we introduced iPhone 13,with more certified recycled materials than anyprevious version of iPhone. We also introduced100 percent recycled aluminum enclosures onevery single model in the iPad lineup.</P>

<H1>Innovating packaging to reduce our footprint</H1>
<P>We’ve made significant progress toward eliminating all plastics from our packaging by 2025.This past year, plastics accounted for only 4 percent of our packaging. Since 2015, we’vededicated our efforts to replacing large plastic trays, wraps, and foam cushioning with fiberalternatives that have higher recovery rates and reduced environmental footprints.</P>
<P><Span>This year, the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro were the first iPhone models to be shipped</Span>
<Link>without any plastic packaging components.8</Link>
<Span>And we replaced plastic foam with a fiber</Span>
<Span>alternative to protect the 24-inch iMac during shipping.</Span>
</P>
<Figure><ImageData src="images\4. Apple 2022 ESG Report_img_101.jpg"/>
</Figure>
<P>For the 24-inch iMac, using corrugated fiber rather than foam for shock absorptionallowed us to reduce plastic by 72 percent.</P>
<P>Product end-of-life</P>
<P>By effectively recovering the materials in ourproducts, we enable the circular supply chainsthat make the best use of finite resources.Through our work in this area, we’re reducingthe need to mine new materials and theamount of energy needed to manufacture newproducts, ultimately driving down emissionsand conserving resources.</P>
<P>In 99 percent of the countries where we</P>
<P>sell products, we continue to provide andparticipate in product take-back and recyclingcollection programs. With the help ofcustomer and employee participation acrossrecycling programs, we directed more than38,000 metric tons of e-waste to recyclingglobally in fiscal year 2021.</P>
<P>We’ve also continued to innovate ondisassembly technologies. Daisy, the robot wedesigned to disassemble iPhone devices, hasnow been joined by Dave, which dismantlesTaptic Engines from iPhone to enable therecovery of materials like rare earth elements,tungsten, and steel, and Taz, designed torecycle modules containing rare earth magnets.At our Material Recovery Lab we’re workingon developing better, more efficient means ofdisassembling products that maximize materialrecovery, while minimizing waste.</P>
<H1>Water stewardship</H1>
<P>We’re committed to managing the resourceswe share with the communities where we andour suppliers operate. Our efforts to addressthe water footprint of our corporate sites andof our suppliers’ sites focus on:</P>
<L><LI>•Using water efficiently</LI>
<LI>•Expanding the use of alternative watersources, including onsite reuse</LI>
<LI>•Discharging water responsibly</LI>
<LI>•Enhancing our water stewardship to keepwatersheds healthy for all who rely on them</LI>
</L>
<P><Span>In fiscal year 2021, our facilities used about</Span>
<Span>1.4 billion gallons of water. We saved 133 million</Span>
<Span>gallons of freshwater this fiscal year due to</Span>
<Link>efficiency projects implemented since 2017.9</Link>
<Span>Last year, alternative water sources accounted</Span>
<Span>for 10 percent of our total corporate water usage</Span>
<Link>— primarily from recycled water sources.10</Link>
</P>
<P><Span>Our supply chain accounts for 99 percent of</Span>
<Span>our total water footprint, based on our detailed</Span>
<Span>water inventory. That’s why we partner closely</Span>
<Span>with our suppliers through our Clean Water</Span>
<Span>Program. The more than 195 participating</Span>
<Span>supplier sites increased their average reuse</Span>
<Span>rate to 41 percent and saved our suppliers</Span>
<Span>12.3 billion gallons of freshwater in fiscal year</Span>
<Span>2021 — for a total of 50.3 billion gallons of</Span>

<H3>Zero waste</H3>
<P><Span>Across our corporate operations, we’re reducing</Span>
<Span>the amount of waste we generate and directing</Span>
<Span>more toward recycling programs. In fiscal</Span>
<Span>year 2021, recycling and composting efforts</Span>
<Span>allowed us to achieve a waste diversion rate of</Span>
<Span>68 percent, limiting landfill waste from our global</Span>
<Link>operations to about 15,000 metric tons.12</Link>
<Span>Our</Span>
<Span>overall waste generated also remained low, in</Span>
<Span>part due to COVID-related temporary closure</Span>
<Span>of facilities. Last year, our Mesa, Arizona, data</Span>
<Span>center became the second Apple facility to</Span>
<Span>receive TRUE certification for zero waste,</Span>
<Link>following the Prineville data center in 2020.13</Link>
</P>
<P><Span>We’ve partnered with our suppliers, recyclers,</Span>
<Span>and waste solution providers to eliminate waste</Span>
<Span>from our manufacturing processes. At the close</Span>
<Span>of fiscal year 2021, more than 100 facilities</Span>
<Span>had been zero waste verified — nearly half of</Span>
<Span>the supplier facilities that are part of our Zero</Span>
<Link>Waste Program.14</Link>
<Span>All participating facilities</Span>
<Span>across 12 countries can access resources</Span>
<Span>including guidance on how to reduce waste and</Span>
<Span>then reuse, recycle, or compost the waste they</Span>
<Span>do create. And we’re seeing results: In fiscal</Span>
<Span>year 2021, suppliers redirected 491,000 metric</Span>
<Span>tons of waste from landfills, bringing the total to</Span>
<Span>over 2 million metric tons since the program’s</Span>

<H2>Smarter chemistry</H2>
<P>The well-being of our employees, customers,people in our supply chain, and the planetis a priority for Apple, which is why we’recommitted to using safer materials to createsafer products. This commitment requiresdiligent work — to build a comprehensivepicture of chemicals across our supply chain,to insist on rigorous chemical managementprocesses, to promote adoption of saferchemical alternatives, and to innovate throughdesign smarter approaches to making ourproducts. Using safer chemistry in ourproducts also enables recycling and materialrecovery, so that our products can be the rawmaterials for the next generation.</P>
<P>The pillars of our smarter chemistrystrategy are:</P>
<P>Mapping and engagement:Engage oursupply chain partners to comprehensivelyidentify the chemicals in the materials usedto make our products, allowing us to drivechange that goes beyond what is requiredfor regulatory compliance.</P>
<P>Assessment and management:Assess thepotential human health and environmental risksof chemicals to evaluate compliance with ourrequirements and inform product design.</P>
<P>Innovation:Drive the development and useof innovative materials that enable the creationof groundbreaking products and also supportindustrywide change.</P>
<H3>Mapping and engagement</H3>
<P>Our Full Material Disclosure (FMD) programmaps the chemicals used in our products —an effort that includes tens of thousands ofparts and assemblies. Then we look at howour products are manufactured. Our ChemicalSafety Disclosure (CSD) program engages withsupply chain partners to get the most recentinformation on which materials are in use.This information includes the volume ofmaterials being consumed and how they’rebeing applied, stored, and handled — as wellas the steps being taken to protect employees.</P>
<P>More than 1000 supplier facilities have sharedtheir chemical inventories as well as storage andsafety protocols as part of our CSD program.Through this process, we’ve identified morethan 17,000 chemicals and applications. Theseefforts contribute to a safer work environmentfor people across our supply chain.</P>

<P>Our assessment system helps to ensure</P>
<P>that only materials that meet our stringentrequirements are used in Apple products. At ourEnvironmental Testing Lab, we evaluate thesafety of our products and materials throughchemical analyses. Our chemists test materialsfor safety and monitor compliance with ourspecifications. In fiscal year 2021, we performedtoxicological assessments on 1000 new materialsto proactively evaluate and eliminate potentiallyharmful substances from our products.</P>
<P>Both the data we gather on chemicals andour rigorous assessments allow us to makeinformed decisions and manage chemicals,for the safety of those who use, make, andrecycle our products.</P>
<H1>Innovation</H1>
<P>The work we do in mapping, assessing, andmanaging the chemicals within our supplychain underpins our innovations. We rely ondetailed information on the material properties,including toxicological data and environmentalperformance characteristics. We also look</P>
<P>at how these materials are used at each</P>
<P>point in the product life cycle, from design, tomanufacturing, to end-of-life. This allows us toseek out and support the development of saferchemistries that have an impact on each phase— and contribute to continually improving theoverall safety of our products and processes.</P>
<P>Since the late 1990s, we have diligentlyidentified and removed potentially harmfulchemicals from our products, such asbrominated flame retardants, beryllium,mercury, and lead. We’re also driving theuse of safer process chemicals in our supplychain: Since 2018, all our final assembly siteshave used only safer alternative cleaners anddegreasers. As we work toward minimizingpotentially harmful chemistries in our productsand processes, we’re making the transition tosafer alternatives accessible to others throughindustry initiatives, partnerships, and standardswith the hope of driving chemical safety acrossthe industry.</P>

<P>Every year, our performance review process helps team members have meaningfulconversations with their managers.</P>
<P>Rotational programs:We also have a numberof programs for new graduates to learn througha combination of training and on-the-jobwork experience. Over a two-year period,participants rotate through multiple teams togain a breadth of experience and exposure tovarious projects to help discover their strengthsand passion. Upon successful completion ofthe program, participants will often transitioninto a non-rotating role within Apple. OurServices, Finance, Operations, and AI/MLfunctions all offer these types of programs.</P>
<H2>Performance reviews</H2>
<P>Our annual performance review processoffers team members the opportunity to</P>
<P>have meaningful conversations with theirmanagers about their performance, growth, anddevelopment. Across Apple, employees receivean annual performance review, and retail teammembers are supported by monthly performanceconversations to align on their progress.</P>
<P>Performance reviews focus on three categories:teamwork, innovation, and results, and theyinclude a self-assessment and feedback frompeers and the team member’s manager. Theperformance review is also a chance to reflecton the contribution each person makes toApple’s long-standing commitment to inclusionand diversity.</P>
<H1>Benefits</H1>
<P><Span>We recognize that our people thrive when</Span>
<Span>they have the resources to meet their needs</Span>

<Span>a host of benefits for corporate and retail</Span>
<Span>employees to help our teams live healthier, more</Span>
<Link>fulfilled, and happier lives at work and beyond.15</Link>
</P>
<P>We regularly review and update the benefits thatwe offer in order to respond to our employees’changing needs. For example, we recentlyexpanded family care services and mental healthbenefits, including 15 free counseling sessionsthrough our Employee Assistance Program, tohelp employees care for themselves and theirloved ones through the pandemic. And in theU.S., we now offer part-time team membersnew vacation and sick leave days, New ParentLeave, Gradual Return to Work, Paid FamilyCare, and Emergency Backup Care, and in 2022,we enhanced sick leave benefits and a newaccelerated vacation accrual schedule for full-timeemployees in our U.S. Apple Store locations.</P>

<H1>Compensation</H1>
<P>We believe that our compensation should notonly be highly competitive across all types ofroles, levels, and talent markets; it should be</P>
<P>equitable and enable all team members to sharein the company’s success as shareholdersof Apple.</P>
<P>We’re committed to being a leader in payequity, providing all employees with annualopportunities for stock ownership in thecompany, and offering highly competitivepay that’s in the top tier of each local market.And we hold our leaders accountable byincorporating Apple values and key communityinitiatives into our executive short-termincentive plan.</P>
<H2>Competitive pay</H2>
<P>Apple is committed to remaining a marketleader in compensation through our highlycompetitive and equitable programs. Inaddition to our stock program and wide rangeof benefits we provide, we regularly review ourcompetitive position to establish our leadingstarting pay rates in each local market.</P>
<H2>Apple stock ownership</H2>
<P>In 2015, we introduced our Stock OwnershipProgram, which was designed to reachemployees who were not previously eligible forrestricted stock unit (RSU) awards, includingall of our retail and AppleCare teams. By theend of 2022, over $1.1 billion of RSU grants willhave been awarded under this program, andthe shares underlying the RSUs today wouldhave an estimated value of over $3 billion(based on a share price of $130.06 as of June16, 2022). Apple is one of the few companiesin the S&amp;P 500, and the largest technologycompany, in which employees at all levels areeligible for RSU grants on an annual basis. In2021, 150,000 employees were eligible forRSU grants and our Compensation Committeeapproved grants for 99% of those eligible.</P>
<P>In most countries, employees also get discountswhen purchasing Apple stock by participatingin the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).Currently, 81 percent of eligible employeesparticipate in the ESPP.</P>
<H2>ESG Modifier</H2>
<P>Beginning in 2021, the CompensationCommittee incorporated the ESG Modifierinto the Executive annual cash incentiveprogram. The ESG Modifier is based on aholistic evaluation by the CompensationCommittee of key accomplishments andactions taken during the year to advanceour Apple values: accessibility, education,environment, inclusion and diversity, privacy,and supplier responsibility, and key communityinitiatives which were chosen because theyrepresent long-standing, business-relevantenvironmental, social, and governanceprinciples that reflect Apple’s commitment topromoting values-driven leadership.</P>
<H2>Pay equity</H2>
<P>Since 2017, Apple has achieved and maintainedgender pay equity for our employees worldwide.In the U.S., we’ve also achieved pay equity withrespect to race and ethnicity — as well as payequity at the intersections of race and ethnicitywith gender.*</P>

<P>Job assessments:Apple’s dedicatedcompensation team regularly conductscomprehensive job title reviews to ensure thatemployees are in the correct job title, which isan important factor in determining pay.

<P>Global compensation history policy:Wedon’t ask candidates for salary history duringthe recruiting process, which has been ourpolicy globally since 2019. Our recruitersdevelop offers of employment based on thecompensation of current Apple employees insimilar roles using a tool developed specificallyfor this purpose.</P>
<H2>Engagement</H2>
<P>At Apple, we believe that open and honestcommunication among team members,managers, and leaders helps create an open,collaborative work environment where everyonecan contribute, grow, and succeed.</P>
<P>Across all our teams, we’re always building onour long-standing commitment to creating anenvironment where people at every level of thecompany feel connected and supported. Ourgoal is to listen and learn — and to use thoselessons to build an even better workplace for all.</P>
<P>If team members have questions, feedback,or concerns, they’re encouraged to sharethem with their manager. If a team member isever uncomfortable raising a particular issuewith their manager, they can discuss it withany manager at Apple, their People BusinessPartner, People Support, or they can contactthe Business Conduct team.</P>

</Figure>
<P>We encourage open and honest communication among team members, managers, and leadership as we seek tobuild a better work environment for all.</P>
<P>Another way team members can let us knowhow Apple is doing is to participate in surveysthat we conduct regularly. These survey resultsare a great way for us to learn about what’sgoing well and how we can do better in areaslike career development, manager performance,and inclusivity, and teams are encouraged tocreate action plans based on the survey results.</P>
<P>We conduct annual surveys for all Apple Storeand AppleCare team members to listen to theirviews on topics like leadership, management,career development, performance, values,culture, and work environment. And leadersfrom each organization use the survey insightsto take steps to better support team memberswhere they need it.</P>
<P>Over the last two years in particular, we focusedon listening to Apple Store and AppleCareemployees as they were interacting mostdirectly with customers during the pandemicand experiencing rapid change in how theyworked to support those customers. For ourearly 2022 surveys, 76 percent of Apple Storeteam members and 73 percent of AppleCareteam members participated.</P>
<P>Apple has a no-retaliation policy. Retaliationagainst anyone who comes forward with aconcern or participates in an investigation isgrounds for termination. We respect each teammember’s right to form or join (or refrain fromjoining) organizations of their choice in a lawfulmanner without discrimination, retaliation,or harassment.</P>

There are several ways team members can report a concern:</P>
<P>Managers:Talking to a manager is a good place to start. A large part of their responsibilityis to support their team members. If a team member is not comfortable bringing a concernto their manager, they can discuss it with any manager at Apple.</P>

<H2>Protecting each other’s health</H2>
<P>At every stage of the pandemic, our firstpriority has always been the health of ourteams, customers, and communities. Thatmeant being one of the first companies toclose our offices and retail stores, and findinginnovative ways to connect with colleagues andcustomers virtually.</P>
<P>Since 2020, we’ve continued our efforts andprograms to support our people. We adoptedCDC recommendations around up-to-datevaccinations, including booster doses. Applealso continued to pay our teams duringtemporary store and office closures, expandedour paid leave policies, and enhanced ourpolicies and procedures for a safe workenvironment — both in the office and in-store.</P>
<P>To keep our teams informed, we deployedcomprehensive resources with up-to-dateCOVID-19 information, including a dedicatedplatform for teams returning to the office.COVID-19 case support, implemented forall team members, included return-to-workguidance and contact tracing, with the utmostregard for employee privacy. We continue tooffer special sick leave for employees withpossible COVID-19 symptoms, as well ascomprehensive health coverage.</P>
<P>To continue to manage our response goingforward, we created a dedicated pandemicresponse team in 2022 in addition to thecross-functional team that has been supportingand guiding our COVID response. The newresponse team will support future pandemicplanning and response.</P>
<H2>Innovating to support our customers</H2>
<P>Despite all of the pandemic’s challenges, webrought our hardware, software, and servicesinto customers’ hands, helping them stayinformed, connected, and entertained.</P>
<P>We also tailored our services to promote easyaccess to trusted information on COVID-19:launching a dedicated section on Apple News;prioritizing visibility of essential serviceslocations — including COVID-19 testing andvaccination locations — on Apple Maps;offering a curated collection of telehealth appson the App Store; and leveraging Siri to providethe latest COVID-19 guidance.</P>
<P>To meet the extraordinary challenges ofvirtual education, we delivered new contentand services for students, parents, andteachers to foster creativity and learning</P>
<P>in a digital environment. We worked withmobile carriers and school administratorsto deliver iPad devices with cellular supportfor students in need. With our Apple CardCustomer Assistance Program, we also offeredcustomers the option to skip their monthlypayments without incurring interest.</P>
<P>Across many of our Apple Store locations,we were able to serve our customers’</P>
<P>needs through contactless pickup, expressstorefronts, and new online support. Ourresponse to COVID-19 is still ongoing, andwe’re committed to implementing healthprotocols and adjusting store operations asrequired based on available data and guidancefrom health officials.</P>

<H1>Supporting people in our supply chain</H1>
<P>We are continuing to work together with oursuppliers to help them ensure that everynecessary precaution is taken to keep peoplesafe at work. In 2020, we introduced anenhancement to our Code and Standardsspecifically addressing Infectious DiseasePreparedness and Response (IDPR). IDPRcontains a set of new requirements resultingfrom our learnings during the pandemic, whichwill help our suppliers better prepare for andbe ready to respond to an infectious diseaseoutbreak at their facility. As part of the rolloutof IDPR in fiscal year 2021, we conductedmore than 200 onsite and remote specializedassessments to verify suppliers’ compliancewith COVID-19 control protocols in order todrive improvement when necessary.</P>
<P>We also continue to assess any existing gapsat supplier facilities, and identify opportunitiesto work with those in higher-risk areas tohelp make their facilities safer. This includesworking with third-party suppliers to redesignand reconfigure factory floor plans where</P>
<P>necessary, implementing flexible working hoursto maximize interpersonal space, implementingenhanced deep cleaning protocols, anddeploying masks and sanitizers. In fiscal year2021, we also encouraged our suppliers’employees to get vaccinated and boostedwhere available.</P>
<P>We also partnered with NGOs to help furthersupport supplier employees, as well as thoseworking deeper in our supply chain, particularlythose from vulnerable groups. We worked withthe International Organization for Migration(IOM) — the world’s leading organizationproviding services to migrant workers — toprovide support to migrant workers impacted</P>
<P>by the pandemic. With support from Apple,our long-time partner Pact, an internationaldevelopment organization, prepared andcoordinated activities to prevent the spread ofCOVID-19 in several mining communities in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Theinitiative has reached more than 50,000 peoplethrough individual and group dialogues onCOVID-19 prevention since the program beganin December 2020.</P>
<H1>Giving back to our communities</H1>
<P>Apple’s company-wide response to theCOVID-19 pandemic involved teams acrossthe business, including product design,engineering, operations, packaging teams,suppliers, and more. At the beginning of thepandemic, when personal protective equipmentwas in short supply, we sourced through oursupply chain and donated more than 30 millionmasks for healthcare workers worldwide.We also launched a company-wide effort toproduce and ship over 10 million face shields.These face shields were delivered to sitesaround the world, from New York PresbyterianHospital in the U.S. to the Ministry of Healthin Zambia.</P>
<P>Additionally, we have also donated over</P>
<P>$10 million to the World Health Organization’sCOVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. We alsomatched employee donations two-to-one tosupport COVID-19 response efforts worldwide.</P>
<P><Span>We awarded $10 million from our Advanced</Span>
<Span>Manufacturing Fund to COPAN diagnostics,</Span>
<Span>a market leader in sample collection kits,</Span>
<Span>that rapidly accelerated their ability to supply</Span>
<Span>sample collection kits to hospitals in the U.S.</Span>
<Span>for COVID-19 testing. And our partnership</Span>
<Span>with Product (RED) also supported COVID-19</Span>

<P>In partnership with the White HouseCoronavirus Task Force and the CDC, wereleased an app and a website that guidedAmericans through a series of questions abouttheir health and exposure to determine if theyshould seek care for COVID-19 symptoms,providing CDC recommendations on nextsteps, including guidance on social distancingand self-isolating, how to closely monitor</P>
<P>symptoms, recommendations on testing,and when to contact a medical provider.And we collaborated with Google to create anew exposure notification system for globalgovernments and health agencies, with userprivacy and security central to its design, tohelp fight the pandemic.</P>

<H1>Health and safety at Apple</H1>
<P>We’re dedicated to protecting our teammembers and our customers everywherewe operate — a responsibility COVID-19 hasbrought into even greater focus. At everystage of the pandemic, we’ve made decisionsbased on the latest local data and public healthguidance, and we share lessons across ourEnvironment, Health, and Safety (EHS) teamsglobally so we can continuously improve oursafety programs.</P>
<H2>Protecting our people</H2>
<P>We’re always working hard to make sure ourworkers are safe no matter where they arewhen they’re conducting business for Apple.We abide by EHS requirements in every countrywhere we operate and are dedicated to doingeverything we can to support the safety andwell-being of our global teams.</P>
<P>Managing work-related hazards and risks</P>
<P>To help ensure the safety of our workers andcustomers, we put procedures in place toidentify workplace risks and mitigate possiblehazards. We support and protect employeesin lower hazard spaces, and we put risk-specific programs in place for those workingin higher hazard environments, including safesystems of work, chemical management,laser safety, equipment and machinery safety,hazardous materials management, andelectrical safety. Employees can request tohave their workspaces individually inspectedto review hazards and controls, includingergonomics evaluations.</P>
<P>Apple implements a hierarchy of controlfor significant risks, which centers onelimination, substitution, engineering controls,administrative controls, and personal protectiveequipment (PPE).</P>
<P>As one example, Apple EHS regularly assesseshazards at our research labs based on theirchemical, equipment, laser, and other hazards.Approximately 9 percent of our labs areconsidered “complex,” meaning that theycontain high-hazard processes and equipment.These assessments help teams understandwhich EHS programs and controls must beput in place to mitigate risks. In 2021, Applecompleted hazard assessments in over 2500research labs globally.</P>
<P>Our EHS teams identify and provide teammembers with appropriate PPE for specifichazards. This PPE is provided at no cost andwith training on correct use. For example,our hearing conservation programs includeevaluation and control of occupationalexposures to noise, and hearing protection isavailable for processes, areas, and tasks withpotential high noise exposures. Additionally,EHS conducts mandatory health checks foremployees where they’re needed.</P>
<P>We invest in new technologies as we continueto manage potential risks across our operations,including our Apple-owned manufacturingsites. Our standards, programs, trainings,procedures, and other safeguards are managedby trained EHS professionals, and whererequired, we also translate EHS procedures intolocal languages for our team members.</P>
<P>Risks identified from incidents, injuries, andnon-routine events are addressed expeditiouslyto identify and implement appropriatecorrective and preventative actions, and weintegrate our learnings into future programdevelopment and training. Lessons learnedare routinely communicated across Apple’sEHS team and potentially affected operations,and they are used to inform updates to existingpolicies and procedures.</P>
<P>Employees and managers can report incidents,near-misses, and observations — includingnewly identified hazards and risks—throughan internal iOS app. Incident responses areaddressed by Apple’s EHS team through aconsistent process that connects employeeswith care and support, while identifyingcorrective actions where appropriate to preventfuture occurrences.</P>
<P>Waste management</P>
<P>Apple is committed to minimizing resourceuse and the associated generation of non-hazardous or hazardous waste. Wherepossible, Apple implements a waste hierarchyof prevention, waste reduction at the source,reuse of materials, recycling, energy recovery,and landfilling as a last resort.</P>
<P>We maintain our commitment to the safe andresponsible management of hazardous waste,both onsite and offsite. Any facility that doesnot meet our requirements is replaced byanother approved waste management facility.</P>
<P>We made progress in 2021 at sites aroundthe world:</P>
<P>U.S.:Thirteen of the Treatment, Storage, andDisposal Facilities (TSDFs) we utilize in the U.S.were audited in 2021 to confirm that the wasteis treated, recycled, or incinerated within thegoverning safety standards for health and theenvironment. Eight disposal facility reviewswere completed by vendors under Applemanagement, and we reviewed five other sitesvia third-party audit reports. At one of our majorresearch labs in Santa Clara Valley, the emptycontainer management program resulted in a3 percent reduction of lab debris for hazardouswaste streams.</P>
<P>United Kingdom:Through an internal initiativeto further strengthen waste management,product site-specific waste initiativesachieved a 97 percent diversion from landfilland a 0.4 tonnes of waste/1002, bothexceeding requirements.</P>
<P>Ireland:The Cork Campus is ECVP 2799 ZeroWaste to Landfill Certified annually and has hadno material landfilled in the past five years.</P>
<P>Ergonomics</P>
<P>In 2021, we continued to support our globalteam members working from home office,Apple office, and non-office settings.</P>
<P>The Apple ergonomics program is heavilyfocused on preventative measures to reducethe risk of work-related musculoskeletaldisorders (WMSDs). This includes ergonomicstraining sessions for our team members andproviding input into the purchase or designof work equipment, systems, and facilities toensure that they meet ergonomic standards toprovide the best levels of efficiency, comfort,health, and safety for anyone using them.

<P>We’re always working hard to make sure our workers are safe no matter where they are whenthey’re conducting business for Apple.</P>
<P>ergonomics trainings and self-assessmentsupport are aimed at creating an awarenessof ergonomic risk factors for WMSDs, how toprevent them, and how to proactively requestfor adjustments to workstations.</P>
<P>We completed over 10,000 individual supportrequests for our team members working fromhome, along with those who returned to Appleoffices and Apple Store locations. Supportincluded tailored guidance and feedback,equipment recommendations, and 1:1 virtualor in-person assessments. In addition, over3000 employees participated in varioustraining sessions.</P>
<P>Our industrial, warehouse, and other non-office operations teams were supported withapproximately 400 ergonomic risk assessmentsand 76 lab screenings. The assessmentsevaluated risk factors such as repetition,force, posture, and duration, while reviewingthe interaction of the team member withnew machines, equipment, work processes,and workspaces.</P>
<P>Emergency preparedness and response</P>
<P>Beyond COVID-19, we supported the responseto dozens of crisis events in 2021, includingfires, severe weather, and civil unrest. Ourresponses focused on the safety of ouremployees and business continuity. Weactivated 31 crisis management teams (CMTs)to manage the most severe events, and 120additional incidents were supported withoutfull CMTs.</P>
<P>All team members can sign up for Apple’sEmergency Alert system, enabling them to benotified of local emergencies and to indicatewhether they are safe or need help. Disastersupplies are available at our facilities. All Applecampuses with over 1000 employees haveFacility Response and Recovery Plans, whichprovide a comprehensive approach to the safetyand support of our employees while minimizingbusiness interruption. Site-specific EmergencyResponse Plans have been implementedglobally. These plans are communicated to allemployees, and trainings and drills are held atleast annually. And our employees are trainedin emergency response, allowing them to reactquickly while supporting the safety of our teammembers and customers.</P>
<P>In 2021, we completed over 200 emergencyresponse drills, which were supported by2700 trained Emergency Response Team(ERT) members. We expect to increase thefrequency of these drills, depending onCOVID-19 restrictions.</P>
<P>With the care and support of our employeesand customers in mind, we deployed AutomaticExternal Defibrillator (AED) stations acrossour global retail stores in 2021. And to ensurethat our team members could effectively usethis new tool, we provided AED training for ourteam members.</P>
<P>All campuses and key sites have disaster suppliesto match localized risks. As Apple’s footprintgrows, sites are evaluated and supplies areadded as needed. As one example, in 2021, welaunched earthquake preparedness campaignsfor employees across the western United Statesand Japan. We conducted outreach to provideemployees with information, tools, and resources,and we held drills in some offices.</P>

<P>To provide a safe and sustainable environmentfor our teams, our EHS programs are built toshare information about risks, requirements,and expectations for all workers.</P>
<P>Our EHS policy outlines our commitmentto workplace safety and environmentalstewardship, and it establishes the principlesthat integrate effective EHS practices into allaspects of our business. The EHS policy iscommunicated through mandatory trainingfor all new employees and through ourinternal EHS website.</P>
<P>Apple’s EHS leadership team, including Apple’sEHS director, is responsible for establishingpriorities, determining annual work plans, andassigning resources to implement high-qualityservices in all geographies where we operate.</P>
<P>Certifications</P>
<P>Our operations in Cork, Ireland, are certifiedto ISO14001, an international standard forenvironmental management systems. AndApple’s Taiwan Technology Center is certifiedto ISO45001 for occupational health and safetymanagement systems, and working towardISO14001 certifications in 2022.</P>
<P>Inspections</P>
<P>Our EHS inspections serve to both identifypotential safety hazards and ensure that we’refollowing our internal processes to mitigatethem. To support this work, Apple formalizedour existing inspections program by launchingenterprise-wide software, which allows usersto create mobile inspections and then carry outinspections and safety compliance audits. Thetool also captures observations, findings, andcorrective actions.</P>
<P>Our inspections tool was deployed globallyto 1050 users across various retail andcorporate locations, including Apple Storelocations, general office spaces, R&amp;D labs,kitchens and cafés, data centers, constructionsites, and laser labs.</P>
<P>Training</P>
<P>In 2021, Apple employees completed 68,249hours of safety training. Apple currentlyoffers 304 safety courses or trainings toour employees.</P>

<Span>(page 99) provides a detailed</Span>
<Span>overview of progress in our supply chain,</Span>
<Span>including efforts to identify, mitigate, prevent,</Span>
<Span>and remedy human rights risks as outlined by</Span>
<Span>the Business and Human Rights Due Diligence</Span>
<Span>process set forth in the UNGPs.</Span>
</P>
<P>We work closely with many experts acrossApple — from product and services designersto facility managers — to evaluate andupdate our Code and Standards annually toaddress emerging risks, incorporate new legalrequirements and industry best practices, andreflect the needs of supplier employees in adynamic operating environment. We engage</P>
<P>with a range of stakeholders, including rights-holders, civil society organizations, academicexperts, and program partners, to ensure</P>
<P>that our Code and Standards reflect currentinternationally recognized labor, human rights,health and safety, and environmental standards.</P>
<H3>Upholding our values from the start</H3>
<P>We work across our business to implement ourstandards from the earliest stages of productdesign and development — from the supplierswe choose to work with, to the materials in ourproducts, to the processes and equipment weuse to make them. We take a comprehensiveapproach to identifying and mitigating risks early</P>
<P>in the procurement and product developmentcycles. Since fiscal year 2020, 9 percent ofprospective suppliers evaluated for Code-related risks have been prevented from enteringour supply chain for being unable or unwilling tomeet our Code and Standards.</P>
<P>Once new suppliers are awarded Applebusiness, we begin the process of helping themquickly get up to speed on our requirementsthrough our supplier onboarding process.In 2021, we expanded our onboarding processto engage new suppliers at an even earlierstage in their working relationship with Apple.</P>
<P>We also extend our support to help prospectivesuppliers correct compliance issues foundduring the procurement process — even whenthe supplier is not awarded Apple’s business— at no cost to the participating companies.Since 2020, 68 percent of companies that werenot awarded Apple business elected to join thisvoluntary program, helping to protect people andthe planet beyond the reach of our business andsupply chain.</P>
<H3>Supplier engagementand accountability</H3>
<P>We take a broad, comprehensive approachto engaging with our suppliers to confirm thatour standards are met. One of the tools thatwe employ are assessments. Assessments,also known as audits, are one of severalmethods we use to measure compliance</P>
<P>with our requirements. These independent,third-party assessments, which take placeonsite at supplier facilities, provide a snapshotof a supplier’s performance. However, whencombined with regular engagement withsupplier teams, mandated reporting, andlistening directly to hundreds of thousandsof supplier employees about their workplaceexperiences, our rigorous supplier assessmentsprovide a clear measure of their performance inupholding our Code and Standards.</P>
<P><Span>In the 2021 reporting period, 1177 assessments</Span>
<Span>were conducted in 52 countries. This included</Span>
<Span>886 Code of Conduct assessments and 291</Span>

<P>Our goal is to work together with suppliers tohelp them improve their management systems,rather than to simply remove them from oursupply chain without helping them correct theissues we have discovered. In the event that asupplier is unwilling or unable to improve theiroperations to meet our requirements, they riskremoval from our supply chain.

<H2>A responsibility thatgrows with our business</H2>
<P>As Apple’s business continues to grow andexpand to new areas, we adapt our supplierengagement model accordingly. This includescontinuing to expand our scope to conductindependent, third-party assessments of agrowing number of suppliers that supportour business outside of manufacturing. Lastyear, we increased our engagement andexpanded the application of our Code andStandards to suppliers supporting newer areasof Apple’s business, including those that workwith our content services like Apple TV+ andApple Fitness+.</P>
<P>These assessments also include unannouncedassessments and unannounced visitsin response to workers’ grievances andallegations, or to verify risks at supplier facilitiesbased on predictive analytics. In fiscal year2021, 211 unannounced assessments andinvestigations were conducted where thesupplier facility was provided no advance noticeof our arrival. This is nearly double the numberconducted in 2020.</P>
<P>In addition to third-party Code of Conductassessments, we require many of our suppliersto also undergo the Responsible BusinessAlliance’s (RBA) Validated Assessment Program(VAP), a facility-wide, third-party assessment</P>
<P>widely used by the industry. A total of 99 RBAVAP assessments were completed in fiscal year2021 at Apple supplier sites.</P>
<P>If we uncover non-compliance in the courseof any assessment or engagement, we takeprompt action so that suppliers not only correctand remedy the issue, but make meaningful,long-term changes to their systems andprocesses. We do this through a CorrectiveAction Plan (CAP), during which 30-, 60-, and90-day check-ins with Apple are required.We then conduct our Corrective ActionVerification (CAV) process to verify that allcorrective actions have been successfullyimplemented, and necessary steps have</P>

<H1>Labor and human rightsin the supply chain</H1>
<P>People come first in everything we do. Ourcommitment to protecting the people in oursupply chain has been unwavering, anchoredby a simple set of beliefs: People deserve to betreated with dignity and to know their rights.They should be able to speak up if those rightsare not being respected — and to know andexpect that when they do, we will listen and act.</P>
<Figure><ImageData src="images\4. Apple 2022 ESG Report_img_179.jpg"/>
</Figure>
<P>We are committed to respecting the rights ofevery individual in our supply chain — just likewe do for our team members, customers, andother partners — and more broadly, to workingwith others to share our tools and the lessonswe’ve learned, and to empowering everyone toachieve progress more rapidly.</P>
<H2>Listening to workers</H2>
<P>Effective grievance channels, ongoing workermanagement communications, and supplieremployee feedback are essential to ensuringrespect for worker rights and maintainingsafe and healthy workplaces. Whetherthrough social dialogue and formal employeerepresentation, workplace satisfactionsurveys, anonymous hotlines, focus groups,or interviews during annual assessments, thefeedback we receive directly from supplieremployees helps us ensure labor and humanrights are respected throughout our globalsupply chain. We also use this feedbackto address emerging risks, improve rightstraining for supplier employees and suppliermanagement, and to continually strengthen ourCode and Standards.</P>
<L><LI>•Rights awareness:We believe thatprotection starts with rights awareness,and since 2008, more than 23.6 millionsupplier employees have been trained ontheir workplace rights. Under our Code andStandards, suppliers are required to provideemployees with training on their workplacerights. This training is generally conductedduring new employee orientation, andcovers international labor standards, locallabor laws, environmental health and safety,and the protections required by our Codeand Standards</LI>
</L>
<P>•Feedback channels:Supplier employeeinterviews are an important part of everyassessment conducted. Each year, weinterview tens of thousands of supplieremployees in their local language andwithout their managers present, to determinewhether or not their experience on the jobaligns with auditors’ observations duringassessments. In fiscal year 2021, despitethe ongoing challenges presented bythe COVID-19 pandemic, we interviewed87,626 workers in our supply chain — over35,000 more than were interviewed in theprevious fiscal year.</P>
<P><Span>Our Code and Standards require effective</Span>
<Span>worker feedback channels, including</Span>
<Span>grievance mechanisms, at all supplier sites.</Span>
<Span>We also provide third-party anonymous</Span>
<Span>hotlines, which are also available to our</Span>
<Span>employees (see</Span>
<Span><Link>page 72), and the ability to</Link>

<Span>time and in any language. When an issue is</Span>
<Span>raised, we require supplier management to</Span>
<Span>immediately investigate and to resolve the</Span>
<Span>issue in a timely manner.</Span>
</P>
<P>In 2021, we launched a grievance hotlineawareness campaign, and its initial rolloutresulted in a 22 percent increase in utilizationof these third-party hotlines. The reportswe received from supplier employees viahotlines in 2021 included issues related towages and benefits, employee relations,amenities at supplier facilities, workforcestability, and health and safety. In each case,we investigated and worked directly with thesuppliers to drive improvement and correctany compliance issues found.

<L><LI>•Workplace satisfaction:In addition tointerviews and grievance channels, we</LI>
</L>
<P>also engage with supplier employeesto understand their overall workplacesatisfaction. In 2021, we anonymouslysurveyed 264,963 supplier employees in191 facilities across Greater China, India,Ireland, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore,UK, U.S., and Vietnam about their workplaceexperiences — nearly double the number ofsupplier employees surveyed last fiscal year.As a result, suppliers took 3944 actions,including better commute options, increasingwages and bonuses, offering better foodvariety, and skill development opportunitiesfor entry-level managers.</P>
<H2>Responsible labor recruitment</H2>
<P>Our Code and Standards, and the protectionsthey provide, apply equally to all workers,regardless of a person’s job, geographiclocation, or how they enter our supply chain— and this commitment begins even beforea worker ever enters our supply chain. Thisincludes zero tolerance for forced labor.</P>
<P>We implement strict policies and procedureswith our suppliers to protect workers in oursupply chain from forced labor. This includesselecting suppliers for assessments basedon factors, such as their geographic location,which may put them at higher risk of forcedlabor violations, as well as their previousperformance and/or history of violations orallegations. Suppliers may also receive additionalspecialized assessments based on the natureof their business or employee population, suchas those that employ Foreign Contract Workers,and those located in higher risk migrationcorridors. Our Code and Standards also requirethat all supplier employees have an effectivemechanism to report grievances. In addition,we provide third-party anonymous hotlines andthe ability to contact the Apple Environment andSupply Chain Innovation (ESCI) team directly atany time and in any language. When an issueis raised, supplier management is required topromptly investigate and to resolve the issue in atimely manner.</P>
<P>We strictly prohibit any form of involuntary laborthroughout our worldwide supply chain and lookfor evidence of it in every supplier assessmentwe conduct, including unannouncedassessments. Last year, we conducted morethan 1100 assessments, and found no instanceswhere anyone was forced to work in oursupply chain.</P>
<P>We did discover two cases in Taiwan in whichpeople paid recruitment fees to secure theirjob, which is a violation of our Code. Werequired the supplier to directly repay theiremployees in full, and verified repaymentthrough a third-party auditor. The payment ofrecruitment fees, withholding an employee’spassport or personal identity documents,or restricting an employee’s freedom ofmovement are Core Violations of our Codeand Standards — the most serious level ofCode violations. If we discover workers havepaid recruitment fees at any point on theiremployment journey to an Apple supplier, werequire supplier management to take promptaction to provide remedy to those affectedby directly repaying their workers for any andall fees, even if the supplier was unawarethat their employees had paid recruitmentfees. From 2008 through fiscal year 2021,our suppliers have repaid $33.2 million inrecruitment fees directly to 37,322 workers.</P>
<P>Finally, in collaboration with the InternationalOrganization for Migration (IOM) and theResponsible Business Alliance (RBA), weexpanded our Responsible Labor RecruitmentToolkit to more than 39 additional supplierfacilities in 10 countries, reaching nearly 77,000workers globally, with 66 percent of thoseworking on Apple production lines.</P>

<H1>How wework toprevent forcedlabor in oursupply chain</H1>
<H2>Apple has zero tolerance for forcedlabor. In the more than 50 countriesand regions where our suppliersoperate, we have teams of experts,including independent third parties,who monitor our suppliers and put inplace industry-leading proceduresto help ensure that no one is forcedto work. Our comprehensive policiesstart before we even sign a contractwith suppliers, and we are consistentlyraising the bar.</H2>

<L><LI>Thorough mapping informs our strategy.</LI>
</L>
<P>An effective strategy requires deep understanding of oursupply chain. To date, we have mapped over 1000 laborrecruitment agencies that work with our suppliers across32 countries.</P>
<H4>A leading strategy requires leading tools.</H4>
<P>The Apple Responsible Labor Recruitment Toolkit, developedin partnership with the International Organization forMigration, provides suppliers and their labor agencies witheasy-to-use tools that help them effectively manage andreport data, mitigating forced labor risks before people evenenter our supply chain. In addition to providing hands-ontraining, we are making these tools openly available for othersto use.</P>
<H4>Awareness is power.</H4>
<P>We require our suppliers to provide their employees withtraining on their workplace rights on their first day on thejob. This helps to ensure that every person is aware of</P>
<P>their rights and what to do if they’re not being respected,which includes the ability to anonymously contact Appledirectly. Foreign Contract Workers, who make up a verysmall percentage of people in our supply chain, also receivetraining prior to leaving their home country, as well as uponarriving in their destination country. To date, our suppliershave provided workplace rights training to over 23.6 millionpeople. In addition, last year we directly engaged with over350,000 people in our supply chain to learn more about theirworkplace experience.</P>
<H4>Investing in consistent improvement.</H4>
<P>Through our new Supplier Employee Development Fund,we’re investing $50M to expand programs designedto continue to improve the rights training experience,worker voice platforms, and supplier employee educationopportunities.</P>

<H4>A close look.</H4>
<P>We regularly conduct independent, third-party assessments,including surprise assessments, of our suppliers, verifyingcompliance with over 500 points across our standards. Thisincludes an extensive document review to be sure all hiringand personnel records are in place and accurate. In additionto specialized forced labor assessments for at-risk suppliers,we also require many suppliers to participate in facility-wideassessments, such as the Validated Assessment Program,to verify performance across the supplier’s entire business.In the event that we find gaps in a supplier’s complianceor capabilities, we require them to implement a CorrectiveAction Plan. To date, our assessments have covered 94percent of our direct manufacturing spend.</P>

<P>is immediately placed on probation, pending the successful</P>
<P>completion of a Corrective Action Plan. Probation can include</P>
<P>no new projects, no new business, and termination of existing</P>

<P>unable or unwilling to meet our standards, they risk removal</P>
<P>from our supply chain. Since 2009, we have directed the</P>
<P>removal of 24 manufacturing supplier facilities and 170</P>

<H2>Health, safety, andwellness</H2>
<P>Everyone has the right to a safe and healthyworkplace. We work from the earliest stagesof product design to ensure that the materials,machines, and processes used in themanufacturing of our products prioritize thehealth and safety of the people working in oursupply chain.</P>
<H3>Building a culture of safety</H3>
<P>Among many topics, our Code and Standardscover the safe handling of chemicals,emergency preparedness, health and safetypermits, living and working conditions, andincident management. Health and safety isalso an important part of every assessment weconduct. Any instances of noncompliance withour Code and Standards during an assessmentare addressed through customized CorrectiveAction Plans, online training materials, andcapability building with EHS experts in orderto improve their future performance. In 2021,we began development of a safety cultureguide to help suppliers cultivate a deeper, moresustainable culture of safety in their facilities.</P>
<H3>Health and wellness</H3>
<P>Beyond keeping people in our supply chainsafe, we’re committed to creating workplaceswhere people can thrive. This means giving oursupplier employees the tools and resources toimprove their physical and mental health andwell-being.</P>
<P>Since 2017, we’ve helped make healtheducation and resources available to more than2.95 million supplier employees on topics such</P>
<P>as reproductive health, disease prevention,and nutrition. In 2021, we conducted a needsassessment to give supplier employees anopportunity to share their feedback, and weare updating our resources with those resultsin mind.</P>
<H3>Safeguarding healththrough safer chemistry</H3>
<P>Our commitment starts with setting andupholding strict material safety standardsthat often go beyond regulatory requirementsin order to protect human health and theenvironment. These are outlined in our Codeand Standards and our Regulated SubstancesSpecification (RSS), and are derived frominternational laws or directives, regulatoryagencies, eco-label requirements, andenvironmental standards. We then go further,by intentionally designing our productsand manufacturing processes to use safermaterials, as well as verifying that the correcthealth and safety protocols are being usedacross our supply chain. And we’re making animpact beyond our supply chain by workingwith others to help make the use of safermaterials the industry norm.</P>
<P>We received the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency’s (EPA) Safer Choice Partner of theYear Award for the second year in a row,in recognition of our leadership in saferchemistry. We’re also a founding signatoryof the Clean Electronics Production Network’s(CEPN) Toward Zero Exposure program,a public platform for companies across theelectronics industry to commit to and reporton their efforts to eliminate workers’ exposureto hazardous chemicals in manufacturing.</P>

<H2>Responsiblematerials sourcing</H2>
<P>From mapping our supply chain and assessingrisk, to conducting independent, third-partyaudits, engaging with civil society and industry,and investing heavily in innovation, upholdingstandards in the sourcing of materials isa responsibility that requires a strategic,comprehensive approach.</P>
<P>As we make progress toward our goal to useonly recycled and renewable minerals andmaterials in our products and packaging,we continue to source primary materials —including tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold(3TG), and other minerals, such as cobalt— responsibly, while working to improveconditions in and around mining communities.</P>
<H1>100%</H1>
<P>of identified 3TG, cobalt and lithiumsmelters and refiners participated inindependent, third-party audits</P>
<P>Our Responsible Sourcing of MaterialsStandard, part of our Code and Standards,covers all primary and recycled materials,including advanced and bio-based materials.Our standard aligns with leading internationalstandards, including the United Nations GuidingPrinciples on Business and Human Rights andthe Organisation for Economic Co-operationand Development’s Due Diligence Guidancefor Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals fromConflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (OECDDue Diligence Guidance).</P>
<P>Every year, as part of our commitment totransparency, we publish a list of identified 3TG,cobalt, and — for the second year — lithiumsmelters and refiners in our supply chain.</P>
<H3>The first battery with100% responsiblysourced key minerals</H3>
<P>We also achieved an industry first</P>
<P>— a battery containing 100 percentresponsibly sourced key minerals,whether primary or recycled. In 2021,all identified cobalt and lithium refiners— key materials used to make batteriesfor all Apple products — participated inOECD-aligned independent, third-partyaudits covering labor, human rights,and environmental policies, as well asmanagement systems. We continue toconduct additional due diligence andcarry out OECD-aligned independent,third-party audits on other batterymaterials such as graphite, nickel,and copper.</P>

<H2>Using our purchasing power for good</H2>
<P>For Apple, our work to make our company more inclusive extends to how wechoose the businesses we work with. When contracting with suppliers, we use ourpurchasing power to increase diversity in our supply chain and change outdatednorms that hurt those who are underrepresented in their field or industry.</P>
<P>Apple’s award-winning Supplier Diversity program, established in 1993, activelyengages suppliers from historically underrepresented communities.</P>
<P>We have policies and procedures that require diverse supplier participation duringearly-stage sourcing, key performance indicators to measure company success,and diversity awareness trainings for our global sourcing team members and relatedApple business units.</P>
<P>In 2016, Apple was the first Silicon Valley–based company to be invitedinto the Billion Dollar Roundtable (BDR) in recognition of our long-standingcommitment to promoting diversity within our supplier base. BDR celebratescorporations that achieved spending of at least $1 billion with minority- andwoman-owned businesses.</P>
<P>In calendar year 2021, Apple spent over $7.1 billion with diverse suppliers around theworld. Our Supplier Diversity program offers support to participating suppliers andseeks active engagement in industry diversity leadership activities. For example,supplier development has been a long-standing commitment within Apple’s supplychain, which is facilitated internally and externally. Externally, we partner with majoruniversities to provide executive development and capacity building to key diversesuppliers. And we’re proud to have supported Michigan State University andHoward University on creating their first programs for diverse supplier development.</P>
<P>A highlight of 2021 was that for the first time we engaged diverse suppliersin North America in manufacturing accessories for some of Apple’s most well-known products.</P>
<P>We’re also promoting diversity in the companies with which we do business.For example, our agreements with our primary construction suppliers requirethe reporting of their efforts to include diverse subcontractors on all Apple-related projects.</P>
<P>As a result of our efforts, we were chosen as Corporation of the Year by the NationalMinority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) in October 2021. This award isNMSDC’s highest honor to a major corporation for the utilization of ethnic minority-owned suppliers, specifically those with Asian-Indian, Asian-Pacific, Black,Hispanic/Latinx, and Indigenous owners.</P>
<H1>Education andprofessional development</H1>
<P>Through our global supply chain, we createopportunities for people around the world,including by helping to close skills gaps inmanufacturing, and by helping to prepareworkers across our supply chain for the jobsof today and tomorrow.</P>
<H2>Supplier Employee DevelopmentFund and Apple Education Hub</H2>
<P>In March 2022, we announced a $50 millionSupplier Employee Development Fund toamplify worker voice and expand access tolearning and skill development opportunitiesto more people in our supply chain and</P>
<P>surrounding communities. Part of thiscommitment will support new and expandedlabor programs reaching more than 3.5 millionsupplier employees in over 40 countries,aided by our strategic partners, including theInternational Labour Organization (ILO) and theInternational Organization for Migration (IOM).</P>
<P>As part of this fund, we also launched theApple Education Hub, informed by our previoussupplier employee learning and developmentprograms, which 5 million supplier employeeshave taken advantage of since 2008. Inpartnership with local educational institutionsand NGOs, the Apple Education Hub willprovide a scalable solution through virtual-first learning, to promote and develop theskills necessary for the future of work in oursupply chain and surrounding communities.With initial programming to begin in the</P>

<P>U.S., China, India, and Vietnam, more than100,000 supplier employees will participatein new learning opportunities by 2023 — fromleadership training and technical certifications,to classes on coding, robotics, and advancedmanufacturing fundamentals.</P>
<H2>Internal leadershipand technical programs</H2>
<P>We work consistently to provide meaningfuleducational opportunities that enrich supplieremployees’ workplace experiences and provideopportunities to improve career paths. Over thepast five years, more than 5000 students haveparticipated in our Line Leader, AutomationTechnician, and general apprenticeshipprograms. These programs give participantsthe skills they need to pursue opportunities inhighly technical roles. In 2021, 5883 supplieremployees at 18 supplier sites participatedin technical training, including programs onrobotics, Computer Numerical Control (CNC)machines, and mobile device repair.</P>
<H2>Coding</H2>
<P>Since 2017, we’ve offered training to supplieremployees on Apple’s Swift coding language— a skill that is in high demand. In 2021, wecontinued to build on feedback from studentsand suppliers to refine our curriculum by addingmore opportunities for virtual learning whilemaintaining the quality and consistency ofthe programs.</P>
<H1>Environment</H1>
<P>Human rights and environmental protectionare inextricably linked. And we’re taking actionaccordingly. As we build products that enrichthe lives of people around the world, we havea profound responsibility to do so in a way thatminimizes our resource use while protecting thelocal environments and communities where weand our suppliers operate.</P>
<P>We work with our suppliers to help us addressour environmental commitments, including ourgoal to become carbon neutral by 2030 acrossour entire product footprint. Our Supplier EnergyEfficiency Program and Supplier Clean EnergyProgram both address direct and indirectemissions in our supply chain, while our SupplierClean Water and Zero Waste programs help toreduce resource usage.</P>
<P>In addition, our Code contains strictenvironmental protections, which require oursuppliers to understand and take active stepsto reduce their environmental impact while alsobecoming better stewards of the resourceswe all share and the communities in whichwe operate. Specifically, our Code addressesthe management of regulated substances,stormwater, wastewater, air emissions, waste,and noise, as well as pollution prevention,resource reduction, and obtaining necessaryenvironmental permits.</P>

<H2>Apple helps suppliers rapidly accelerate renewableenergy use around the world</H2>
<P>In April 2022, Apple announced that its suppliers more than doubled their useof clean power over the last year, with over 10 gigawatts operational today outof nearly 16 gigawatts in total commitments in the coming years. In 2021, theserenewable projects avoided 13.9 million metric tons of carbon emissions. Theprojects online today will support greenhouse gas reductions equivalent toremoving 3 million cars from the road for one year.</P>
<P>Apple is constantly working with its global supply chain to accelerate andsupport its transition to clean energy. As of March 2022, 213 of the company’smajor manufacturing partners have pledged to power all Apple production withrenewable electricity across 25 countries. The dozens of new commitmentsannounced this year will accelerate progress toward Apple’s 2030 goal tobecome carbon neutral across its entire supply chain.</P>

<P>Hand in hand with the privacy of our users areour commitments to free expression and accessto information. Our products and services helpour customers learn, express their creativity,exercise their ingenuity, communicate privatelyand securely, and share information globally,whether by text message, audio, or signlanguage over FaceTime video.</P>
<H1>Designed for privacy</H1>
<P>Our products and services are built withinnovative privacy technologies and techniquesdesigned to minimize how much of your dataApple — or anyone else — can access. Theycontain features designed and implementedover decades to protect customers’ privacyand give them control over their information.</P>
<H1>Privacy and securityon the App Store</H1>
<P>To meet the highest standards for privacy,security, and content, all the apps in our AppStore agree to comply with our App StoreReview Guidelines.</P>
<P>These provide developers with clear andtransparent guidance on safety, performance,business, design, and legal issues, includingappeal rights. The guidelines help ensure thatthe apps offered on the App Store are safe,provide a good user experience, adhere toour rules on user privacy, and secure devicesfrom malware and threats.</P>
<P>Safari was the first browser to block third-party cookies by default as far back as 2003,and in 2017, Safari added Intelligent TrackingPrevention to further limit tracking whilestill enabling websites to function normally.</P>
<P>Random identifiers ensure that routescustomers take and the places they searchin Maps are not associated with their AppleID, and Messages and FaceTime are end-to-end encrypted, so Apple can’t eavesdrop onuser communications. Siri was designed fromthe very beginning in 2011 to not associatethe things that users say to Siri with theirApple ID, but instead uses a random identifiergenerated when a user first enables Siri. Thathas remained the same since then, and in2021, with newly introduced on-device speechrecognition, the audio of users’ Siri requestsis processed right on their iPhone or iPadby default.</P>
<P>Throughout the App Store ecosystem, wecontinue to add innovative new features thatadvance user privacy even further. PrivacyNutrition Labels require developers, includingApple, to report their data collection andprivacy practices in a standardized format. AndApp Tracking Transparency requires developersto obtain a user’s permission to track theirdata across apps or websites owned by othercompanies for use in advertising or shared withdata brokers.</P>
<P>Apple’s Privacy Policy ensures that privacyremains a top priority in all that we do. Oursuppliers are also obligated to apply our privacyprinciples via our contractual terms. We respectusers’ ability to know, access, change, transfer,restrict, and delete personal data, and westrive to collect the minimum amount of datanecessary to power our products and services.</P>

<P>Privacy Impact Assessments</P>
<P>As part of our General Data ProtectionRegulation (GDPR) and human rights work, weundertake Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs)of our major products and services. Theseassessments also consider decision-makingthat relies on algorithmic systems and theimpact such decisions have on individuals andtheir rights. PIAs take into consideration howlaws affect privacy and assess any associatedrisks in the relevant jurisdictions where weoperate. PIA reviewers are also trained toidentify and highlight potential impacts tofreedom of expression. Apple regularlyengages with a wide range of civil societyrepresentatives globally on various privacy andfreedom of expression issues, including privacyby design and encryption.</P>

<Span>, Apple was the first to directly connect</Span>
<Span>hearing aids or a cochlear implant to iPhone</Span>
<Span>and other iOS devices through the Made for</Span>
<Span>iPhone (MFi) program. This enables customers</Span>
<Span>to make phone calls and stream high-quality</Span>
<Span>audio directly to their MFi hearing devices. And</Span>
<Span>in 2021, Apple added support for the latest</Span>

<P>Apple’s innovative software features introduce new ways for users with disabilitiesto navigate, connect, and get the most out of Apple products.</P>
<P>We work with various nonprofit organizationsaround the globe to strategically align andsupport each other, and we maintain constantcontact with community organizations tohelp ensure that we are exceeding theirexpectations. We also work with internationalstandards organizations to expand equalaccess to information and functionality whileworking to protect and improve the rights,inclusion, and equity of people with disabilities.</P>
<P>Apple follows policy developments and sharesits best practices with regulators, governments,and organizations, including the World HealthOrganization (WHO) and the EuropeanDisability Forum (EDF).</P>
<P>Working with the World Federation of theDeaf, the American Council of the Blind, theCerebral Palsy Foundation, and the NationalAssociation of the Deaf, Apple proposed theadoption of accessibility-themed emoji tothe Unicode Consortium, the global body incharge of setting character standards across allcomputing platforms. In 2019, the consortiumadopted Apple’s recommendation for moreinclusive and representational emoji. And in2021, we expanded the accessibility options forMemoji to include cochlear implants, an oxygentube, and a soft helmet.</P>
<H1>Inclusive design</H1>
<P>Building on our accessibility work, we’vealways believed that in order to create the mostpersonal technology in the world, we mustconsider the full range of human experiences.All across Apple there is a sustainedcommitment to making products more inclusivefor a wide range of diverse groups. Apple</P>
<P>engineers work hand in hand with teams acrossthe business to help solve unique problemsothers seldom think about.</P>
<P><Span>For example, with iOS 14.5, Siri no longer has a</Span>
<Span>default voice, allowing users to choose the voice</Span>
<Span>that speaks to them when they first set up their</Span>
<Span>device, and in English, users can now select</Span>
<Span>more diverse voice options. We’re also taking</Span>
<Span>steps to ensure equity in our cameras’ automatic</Span>
<Span>person recognition features so that everyone</Span>
<Span>can have the same extraordinary experience,</Span>
<Span>no matter the photographic subject’s skin color,</Span>
<Span>age, or gender. As a result, the machine learning</Span>
<Span>models used in camera technology must show</Span>
<Span>similar performance across various age groups,</Span>

<H1>Education</H1>
<P>For more than 40 years, we’ve workedalongside educators to inspire the nextgeneration of learners, supporting creativity,problem-solving, communication, andcollaboration. We believe that education canbe a great equalizing force, and our goal is toempower all educators and learners throughtechnology that protects student privacy and isaccessible for all learners.</P>
<P>We develop products, programs, tools, andcurricula for educators to create engaginglearning experiences, and we supporteducation leaders and administrators so theycan get the most out of the technology in theclassroom and beyond.</P>
<P>Coding is a universal language, and a greatway to help students think critically and expresstheir creativity. We’re always working to makeit easy and fun to learn to code, with supportiveresources like Swift Playgrounds and theEveryone Can Code curriculum. And we workhand in hand with communities — particularlycommunities of color and others that are under-resourced — to bring coding, creating, andentrepreneurship opportunities to learnersof all ages.</P>
<H2>Products for learning</H2>
<P>Knowing that everyone has their own wayof learning and expressing themselves, weoffer products that support students andeducators from kindergarten through highereducation. iPad provides apps and advancedtechnologies that help educators teach andstudents push the boundaries of their creativity.The Augmented Reality capabilities on iPad let</P>
<P>students bring digital objects into the real worldto spark curiosity and enhance understandingin new, exciting ways. And the powerful Macprocessors are equipped for the most intensivetasks, throughout university and far beyond.</P>
<P>We also developed Apple School Manager,a free web-based portal that helps ITadministrators in K–12 and higher educationinstitutions effortlessly configure, deploy,and manage iPad and Mac devices.</P>
<H2>Teaching tools</H2>
<P>Our teaching tools empower educators topersonalize the learning experience for eachstudent and manage the classroom to keepevery student on task. Our Classroom app servesas a powerful teaching assistant that makes iteasy to navigate lessons and share information,while the Schoolwork app aids the distributionand collection of assignments, tracks progress,and supports collaboration with students.</P>
<H2>Curricula and project guides</H2>
<P>Our programs help educators integratecreativity and coding into their lessons, evenif they’re new to teaching with technology:</P>
<P>Everyone Can Create:Gives educatorsfun and meaningful ways to bring creativeexpression into any lesson, topic, orassignment. The free guides teach studentsto develop and communicate ideas throughdrawing, photography, video, and music, whileteacher guides help educators integrate bothtechnology and creativity into every lesson.</P>
<P>Everyone Can Code:Guides students throughthe Swift Playgrounds app on iPad and Mac.This free curriculum and the app teach codingfor kids through a world of interactive puzzles</P>
<H2>Expanding horizons with Inclusive App Design</H2>
<P>Educators can also try Apple’s new one-hour Inclusive App Design activity to introducestudents to the world of coding and app development. During Europe Code Week inOctober 2021 and through Computer Science Education Week in December 2021, Appleencouraged educators and their students to participate in an introductory Inclusive AppDesign activity. This new lesson from Apple helps educators guide students through a one-hour session to turn their ideas into apps with inclusion and accessibility in mind. The appdesign process helps students identify problems they care about, and then plan, prototype,and code creative solutions. It helps students think critically about how to build apps thatare inclusive for all and prepares them to be the innovators of tomorrow.</P>

<H1>Health</H1>
<P>Apple empowers our users to take control oftheir health by making it easier to track andshare their health and wellness informationwhile always keeping their data secure. Thisallows for a more informed dialogue with lovedones and doctors, offering the ability to makebetter health choices on a daily basis.</P>
<P>Privacy is a fundamental aspect of our healthwork. The right place for health information toexist is with a user on their device, and whereor how that information is shared should becompletely up to the individual.</P>
<H2>Technology for better health</H2>
<P>Since launching Apple Watch in 2015, we’vebeen constantly inspired by the stories we hearfrom our users about how using Apple Watchfor health and fitness has changed their lives.These range from users who found closing theirActivity rings every day motivated them to be inthe best shape of their lives to those alerted toa potential irregular heart rhythm who soughtmedical care to confirm. Stories like thosecontinually drive us to do more for our users.</P>
<P>Building on innovative features for Apple Watchlike the ECG app, irregular rhythm notifications,and fall detection, Apple recently introduceda variety of services and features to helppeople on their health and fitness journeys.Apple Fitness+ is an award-winning fitnessand wellness service powered by Apple Watchand designed to be welcoming to all, whereverthey are in their journey.

<P>On iPhone, Walking Steadiness is an industryfirst, providing insight into fall risk by leveragingimportant mobility data as users walk with theiriPhone, directly within the Health app. TheHealth app provides a consolidated view ofusers’ health information — data from iPhone,third-party apps, and Apple Watch. And sinceintroducing the Health Records feature in2018, it is supported at over 800 healthcareinstitutions with over 12,500 care locationsacross three regions — the U.S., Canada,</P>
<H2>Investigator Support Program</H2>
<P><Span>Inspired by the innovative ways the research,</Span>
<Span>clinical, and developer communities leverage</Span>
<Span>our products and platforms, we launched the</Span>
<Span>Investigator Support Program that provides</Span>
<Span>researchers with opportunities to receive</Span>
<Span>Apple Watch to include in their research study.</Span>
<Span>We have witnessed firsthand how researchers</Span>
<Span>and clinicians are able to accomplish even</Span>
<Span>more with the addition of Apple Watch to their</Span>
<Span>research and care programs, and through this</Span>
<Span>program we hope even more people can have</Span>
<Span>the same kind of success. Currently, studies</Span>

<H1>Safety for children and families</H1>
<P>Families love iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch,and Apple TV because they are some of themost powerful tools ever made for learning,exploring, and staying in touch. We’re committedto providing tools that let caregivers know, andfeel good about, what kids are doing. A range offeatures offer flexibility to track app usage, setlimits on screen time and community, choosewhich apps children can use, and manage thecontent and websites they can access.</P>
<P>Features also help protect kids from what theysee and send. With the latest versions of iOS,iPadOS, and macOS, families can set up kids’devices to show warnings when receiving orsending images containing nudity. The imageis blurred, and the child gets an alert along with</P>

<P>helpful resources and the option to messagesomeone they trust for help. End-to-endencryption is maintained, and Apple doesn’tget access to your messages.</P>
<P>Apple has also expanded guidance in Siri,Spotlight, and Safari Search by providingadditional resources to help children andfamilies stay safe online and get help withunsafe situations. For example, users who askSiri how they can report child exploitation willbe pointed to resources for where and howto file a report.</P>
<H1>The App Store:A safe place for kids</H1>
<P>The Made for Kids section on the App Storeis carefully curated to be a great space forchildren. And we review apps to help makesure they do what they say they do. In ContentRestrictions, you can also tap an age rangeand, just like that, your kids can buy ordownload only apps appropriate for them.</P>

<P>We collect devices for refurbishing and reusethrough several programs, including AppleTrade In, the iPhone Upgrade Program,AppleCare, and our corporate HardwareReuse Program. In fiscal year 2021, we sent12.2 million devices and accessories to newowners for reuse.

For example, Apple’sRegulated Substances Specification restrictsthe use of certain chemical substances in Appleproducts, and we apply rigorous additionalcontrols for materials that may have prolongedcontact with the skin. Components that arecritical to safety are subject to enhancedrequirements and additional supplier audits.</P>
<P>Apple tracks customer reports of potentialproduct safety issues, and employeesare trained on how to handle, document,and properly escalate such reports. Appleinvestigates reported incidents and alsoanalyzes products for potential safety issues.In the rare event that Apple determines aproduct poses a potential safety risk, we takeaction to recall the product, which includesnotifying customers and helping customershave their products repaired, replaced,or refunded.</P>
<P>Apple’s Safety Compliance Policy definesprocedures to monitor products in the field andinvestigate potential safety issues. This policyrequires escalation of safety issues to Applemanagement and timely reporting to regulatorswhere necessary. It also requires mechanismsfor employees to confidentially report safetyor compliance concerns, as well as training foremployees on how to address the concerns.Our Product Integrity and Legal teams areresponsible for ensuring that Apple’s SafetyCompliance Policy is followed.</P>

<H2>People at Apple don’t just serve our communities — we’re a part of them. That’s whyeverywhere Apple is, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to be a force for equity andopportunity, to protect the planet we share, and to help our users get the most out oftheir technology. Whether we’re working with educators, nonprofit leaders, or the globaldeveloper community, we believe in using our technology, our resources, and our voiceto help people make a difference in their communities. We can achieve so much morewhen we work together — with our neighbors — to build a better future for all.</H2>
<H2>Our approach</H2>
<P><Span>At Apple, we’re committed to leaving the world</Span>
<Span>better than we found it. That means supporting</Span>
<Span>communities with global and local initiatives,</Span>
<Span>investments, and donations that combat</Span>
<Span>inequity, expand access to opportunity, and</Span>
<Span>help respond to urgent needs. Many of these</Span>
<Span>initiatives also contribute to the UN Sustainable</Span>
<Span>Development Goals (see Appendix</Span>

<P>Some of our largest community initiatives addressracial equity and justice, education, affordablehousing, and other critical issues where we canuse our presence, expertise, and resources tomake a difference. Through these efforts, wefoster open communication with local communitypartners and stakeholders to understanddynamic challenges in order to drive meaningfulimpact. Apple supports these initiatives throughprogram development, donations to nonprofitpartners, and values-based investments, whichgo beyond financial returns to promote positivesocial and environmental impact.</P>
<P><Span>Through our values-based investments, we</Span>
<Span>see an important opportunity to continue to</Span>
<Span>invest our capital for good — often through</Span>
<Span>multiyear commitments in which Apple plays</Span>
<Span>a substantive role in the project development.</Span>
<Span>Our affordable housing initiative, Racial Equity</Span>
<Span>and Justice Initiative, clean energy investments,</Span>

<H1>Racial Equity andJustice Initiative</H1>
<P>We have an urgent responsibility to helpdismantle systemic racism and supportopportunities for Black, Hispanic/Latinx, andIndigenous communities. Our Racial Equityand Justice Initiative (REJI) is focused on threekey areas: expanding access to education,supporting criminal justice reform, andremoving economic barriers for communitiesof color.</P>
<P>The initiative began in June 2020 with aninitial commitment of $100 million, followedby an additional $30 million commitment inAugust 2021, to help elevate equity-focusedsolutions across the academic and advocacylandscapes, and a $25 million commitmentin May 2022 to expand access to capital forcommunity financial institutions supportingcommunities of color.</P>
<P>REJI has spurred new partnerships and projectswhile inspiring us to weave a focus on equityand justice into everything we do — includingour existing community programsand business operations.</P>

<P>leadership, Apple is collaborating with minority-serving institutions on programs designed tobuild a more inclusive workforce.</P>
<P>Propel Center:In January 2021, Apple, incollaboration with Southern Company anda range of community stakeholders, helpedlaunch the Propel Center, a global innovationand learning hub for the HBCU community.The Propel Center supports HBCU studentsand faculty through a robust virtual platform,a physical campus in the historic AtlantaUniversity Center, as well as on-campusactivations at partner institutions. The centeris designed to support the next generation ofdiverse leaders, providing innovative curricula,technology support, career opportunities,and fellowship programs. Experts fromApple support the development of curriculaand provide ongoing mentorship andlearning support.</P>
<P>HSI Innovation Hub:In August 2021, weannounced our partnership with CaliforniaState University (CSU) Northridge’s Global HSIEquity Innovation Hub, which aims to transformHSIs throughout the CSU system and the U.S.in order to increase student success and equipLatinx and other students from historicallyunderserved groups with skills for high-demand careers in STEM.

<P>Currently, only 2 percent of all U.S. teachers are Black men, something theprogram at Huston-Tillotson is working to change. When Black students aretaught by a Black teacher, they’re significantly more likely to graduate from highschool and consider attending college. To support Huston-Tillotson University’sAfrican American Male Teacher Initiative, Apple is providing scholarships for theprogram’s students, called Pre-Ed Scholars, as well as hardware, software, andprofessional development courses for students and faculty. Apple’s multiyearpartnership with Huston-Tillotson complements other engagements we’veestablished through our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, working alongsidethe HBCU community to develop curricula and provide new learning andworkforce opportunities.</P>

<P>that are historically underrepresented andunderresourced in technology.</P>
<P>CEI partners with K–12 and higher educationinstitutions, community-based organizations,and nonprofits to bring coding, creativity,and workforce development opportunities toeducators and learners of all ages. CEI aims tobuild knowledge and skills for high-demand,high-growth technical careers alongsidecommunities that have been traditionallyunderresourced to advance education equity.Our support includes hardware grants,monetary grants to support scholarships andprogramming, resources for educator training,curriculum development, and employeeengagement opportunities.</P>
<P>Through educational partnerships acrossthe U.S., we’ve been able to reach tensof thousands of students and educatorswho might not have had access to ourtechnology and education resources. As ofApril 2022, we’ve supported and partneredwith 147 education institutions and nonprofitorganizations — including 47 HBCUs — in over500 different locations across 36 states in theU.S. and four locations across the UK since theinitiative launched in 2019.</P>
<P>Grounded in the positive relationships thatwe’ve established with these organizations,we’re working to deepen our impact inthree areas:</P>
<P>Educator development:We’re providingeducator development and trainingopportunities to build the knowledge andskills that educators need to teach codingin underrepresented communities throughTeacher Coding Academies and the CEILearning Series. These programs allowhundreds of teachers from around the U.S.to meet virtually and in person to sharebest practices for integrating and teachingcoding and creativity concepts. Throughour Academies and CEI Learning Series,we’re connecting CEI educators with AppleDistinguished Educators from all around the</P>
<P>world. Apple Distinguished Educators lead andparticipate in learning workshops, along withour Apple Professional Learning Specialists.</P>
<P>Out-of-school-time learning:We’repartnering with nonprofits, NGOs, andcommunity-based organizations that provideout-of-school-time learning experiencesto increase exposure, awareness, andexperiences through coding and creativity.</P>

<H1>Apple Developer Academy</H1>
<P>As the iOS app economy continues to grow,we’re investing in educational programs andopportunities that prepare learners of all agesand backgrounds for the jobs of the future.</P>
<P>In 2013, we started the Apple DeveloperAcademy to empower entrepreneurs, creators,and coders by helping them cultivate the skillsnecessary to pursue new career opportunities.The program focuses on communities withhigh youth unemployment and is open toanyone, regardless of academic backgroundor experience. We seek to spark interest</P>
<P>among the next generation of developers andbring diverse representation to the growingapp ecosystem, particularly among womenand individuals from underrepresentedcommunities. A larger and more diversedeveloper community helps create more newideas and businesses, and it gives more peopleaccess to employment and opportunities foreconomic mobility. Some participants are alsoundertaking practical projects in collaborationwith NGOs to help use technology to solvechallenges related to their missions, whichamplifies impact even further.</P>
<P>We offer two distinct training programs as partof the Apple Developer Academy: 1) 30-dayfoundations courses that cover specific topicareas, including an introductory course forthose considering app development as a careerpath, and 2) a more intensive academy programof at least 10 to 12 months that dives deeperinto coding and professional skills. In additionto partnering with institutions, the academyworks closely with employers to provide directpathways to career opportunities. Participantsalso have access to a strong alumni networkas they move forward in their careers.</P>
<P><Span>As of April 2022, we have 23 foundation</Span>
<Span>programs and 17 academy programs across</Span>
<Span>the globe working in close collaborations with</Span>
<Span>institutions that provide content and experience</Span>
<Span>opportunities. The programs are based in seven</Span>

</P>
<P><Span>On average, job-seeking graduating students</Span>
<Span>receive three job offers, and 92 percent of</Span>

<Span>We also see high</Span>
<Span>rates of students staying in the industry. For</Span>
<Span>example, 62 percent of students are still</Span>

</P>
<P>We’re also making progress on our commitmentto support underrepresented groups. In 2021,40 percent of academy students were female,a 63 percent year-on-year increase, and</P>

We support2.8 million jobs across all 50 states through directemployment, spending with U.S. suppliers andmanufacturers, and the iOS app economy. InApril 2021, Apple announced an accelerationof its U.S. investments, with plans to make newcontributions of more than $430 billion and add20,000 new jobs across the country over the nextfive years.

<H1>Stakeholder engagement</H1>
<P>Apple engages with stakeholders as part ofour commitment to advance meaningful changeand find novel solutions to pressing challenges.</P>
<P>Every day, at all levels of the business, weinteract with a variety of stakeholders tolisten and learn from others’ perspective andexperiences, share our progress, and promotebest practices. Stakeholders provide valuableexpertise as we develop our programs, and bycollaborating with other stakeholders, we candrive more impact on the issues we care aboutthan any one of us could make on our own.</P>
<P>Throughout the year, we proactively engagewith a wide range of stakeholders and rightsholders, including:</P>
<H2>Our people</H2>
<P>We believe that open and honest communicationamong team members, managers, andleadership fosters an open, collaborative workenvironment where everyone can participate,develop, and thrive. Our peoples’ voices andideas drive innovation in everything we do</P>
<P><Span>— from informing diversity initiatives to the</Span>
<Span>inclusive benefits that support employees of</Span>
<Span>all backgrounds through every life stage. In</Span>
<Span>addition to managers listening to their teams,</Span>
<Span>we conduct surveys to better understand team</Span>
<Span>member views across key topics, and we provide</Span>
<Span>channels for employees to share concerns</Span>
<Span>with leadership.</Span>

<H2>Suppliers</H2>
<P>Whether through social dialogue and</P>
<P>formal employee representation, workplacesatisfaction surveys, anonymous hotlines,focus groups, or interviews during annualassessments, the feedback we receive directlyfrom supplier employees helps us ensurethat labor and human rights are respectedthroughout our global supply chain. We alsouse this feedback to address emerging risks,improve rights training for supplier employeesand management, and continually strengthenour Supplier Code of Conduct and SupplierResponsibility Standards.</P>
<H2>Customers</H2>
<P><Span>We’re motivated by creating the best user</Span>
<Span>experience through our products and in every</Span>
<Span>interaction with our customers. To help ensure</Span>
<Span>quality, we continually monitor customer</Span>
<Span>feedback, assess key drivers, and leverage</Span>
<Span>analytics to improve the customer experience.</Span>
<Span>Customer feedback is shared with team</Span>

<L><LI>1.Apple is carbon neutral for corporate emissions as of April 2020.</LI>
<LI>2.Emissions from R&amp;D processes.</LI>
<LI>3.Beginning in FY2021, we’re accounting for scope 2 emissions from thepurchase of district heating, chilled water, and steam.</LI>
<LI>4.In fiscal year 2017, we started calculating scope 3 emissions not listed inthis table. In fiscal year 2021, these include electricity transmission anddistribution losses amounted to about 28,000 metric tons CO2e and lifecycle emissions associated with renewable energy amounted to about95,000 metric tons CO2e. We have not accounted for emissions resultingfrom employees working from home, because we anticipated theseemissions are small relative to our carbon footprint and we are still evolvingour methodology.</LI>
<LI>5.We regularly revisit our methodology to hold ourselves to high accountabilitystandards. So in fiscal year 2018, we changed how we calculate emissionsfrom business travel in order to better account for classes of service in airtravel. As a result of this change, our scope 3 transportation emissionsincreased by 77 percent between 2017 and 2018. Without the methodologychange, these emissions would have increased by 14 percent, which reflectsthe growth in our business.</LI>
<LI>6.Beginning in fiscal year 2020, we updated our methodology to reflect theimpact of COVID-19 on employee commute.</LI>
<LI><Span>7.We retired 167,000 metric tons of carbon credits from the</Span>
<Link>Chyulu Hills</Link>
<Span>project</Span>
<Span>in Kenya to maintain carbon neutrality for our corporate emissions in fiscal</Span>
<Span>year 2021. This project is certified to the VCS and CCB standards.</Span>
</LI>
<LI>8.Because we’re committed to accuracy and transparency, we regularly refineour product life cycle assessment model and sources of data. For example,we recently obtained more granular data summarizing in which countries ourproducts are sold and used, resulting in more granularity possible for gridemission factors used in the carbon footprint of the product use phase. Thenet result was an increase in our 2021 carbon footprint. When using thesame level of data granularity and model as 2021, our product use carbonemissions in 2021 would have been about 2.5 percent lower.</LI>
<LI><Span>9.For fiscal year 2021, we retired credits from the Chyulu Hills project in Kenya,</Span>
<Span>and purchased carbon credits from two additional projects to offset a total</Span>
<Span>of 500,000 metric tons of direct emissions across our value chain. The</Span>
<Link>first</Link>
<Link>project</Link>
<Span>, a REDD+ coastal conservation project in Guatemala, protects and</Span>
<Span>conserves forests from deforestation and degradation. The</Span>
<Link>second project</Link>
<Span>aims to establish forests on about 46,000 hectares of barren land that is not</Span>
<Span>otherwise in use across seven counties in the Guizhou Province of China.</Span>
<Span>Both projects are certified to the same high standards that we require for</Span>
<Span>projects in the Restore Fund, including VCS and CCBS. These projects are all</Span>
<Span>certified to the VCS and CCB standards.</Span>

<L><LI>1.Beginning in FY2021, we’re accounting for the purchase of district heating,chilled water, and steam.</LI>
<LI>2.Because energy efficiency measures have lasting benefits, energy efficiencysavings are calculated cumulatively since 2012. All efficiency measuresare retired based on their effective useful lifetime as documented by theCalifornia Energy Commission. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, corporatefacilities energy use declined temporarily as we adjusted lighting and climatecontrols due to shutdowns and reduced occupancy. These savings are notincluded in the total savings from our energy efficiency program initiatives.We also recognize that energy use at our employees’ homes likely increasedduring this period. We have not accounted for this energy use, because weanticipated this impact is small relative to our overall energy use and we arestill evolving our methodology.</LI>
<LI>3.Energy savings from supplier energy efficiency improvements are reportedas annualized annual numbers. Prior to 2020, supplier energy savings arecalculated on a calendar year basis. Beginning in 2020, supplier energysavings are calculated based on the fiscal year.</LI>
<LI>4.Beginning January 1, 2018, 100 percent of the electricity we use to power ourglobal facilities is sourced from renewable energy.</LI>
<LI>5.Supply chain renewable electricity capacity (operational) and renewableelectricity use for FY2021 do not include REC purchases Apple made,equivalent to 0.3 GW and 500,000 MWh, respectively, to address a smallincrease to its carbon footprint.</LI>

<Span>This total includes freshwater use as well as</Span>
<Span>alternative water sources, including recycled</Span>
<Span>water, rainwater, and recovered condensate. We</Span>
<Span>define freshwater as drinking-water quality, the</Span>
<Span>majority of which comes from municipal sources</Span>
<Span>and less than 5 percent comes from onsite</Span>
<Span>groundwater sources. Recycled water represents a</Span>
<Span>key alternative water source. Our recycled water is</Span>
<Span>sourced primarily from municipal treatment plants,</Span>
<Span>with less than 5 percent from onsite treatment.</Span>
<Span>Recycled water is primarily used for irrigation,</Span>
<Span>make-up water in cooling, or toilet flushing. Other</Span>
<Span>alternative sources of freshwater include rainwater</Span>
<Span>and recovered condensate that is captured onsite.</Span>
<Span>Water used for construction for activities like dust</Span>
<Span>control is not included in this total, and represents</Span>
<Span>13 million gallons of water used in fiscal year 2021.</Span>
<Span>Our actual water discharge may vary by 10 percent</Span>
<Span>relative to our estimates. In these estimates, we’ve</Span>
<Span>taken into account consumptive activities including</Span>

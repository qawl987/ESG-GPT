<Document><Art><Sect><P>The aerospace manufacturing and aviation industries play a profound role in our world. Safety will always be our top priority. <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
Sustainability represents an opportunity for <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 us to define our next chapter together, with  <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
a focus on reducing carbon emissions and enabling people everywhere to travel and fly responsibly. These efforts make it possible  for the next generation of aerospace workers to continue to enjoy rewarding careers, strengthen the fabric of the communities where we operate, and collaborate within our industry for environmental stewardship (E), social progress (S) and transparent governance (G).</P>
<P>Boeing’s mission is to protect, connect and explore our world and beyond. Every day, we are dedicated to carrying out our mission — safely and sustainably. Boeing is pursuing sustainable aerospace together because we know it is an imperative and because our teammates are committed to making the <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 world better for future generations.</P>
<P>Throughout Boeing’s long history, we have looked for ways to enhance sustainability in everything we do. This commitment to innovate is deeply rooted in our core values, where we continue to reinforce safety as our top priority, strive for first-time quality and hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards to support a more sustainable future.</P>
<P>By 2050, our industry sees a world where air travel will carry over 10 billion passengers a year, support 180 million jobs and generate nearly $9 trillion in economic activity, all while furthering our goal of minimizing the impact <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 on our planet and striving to achieve the <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
commercial aviation industry’s ambition  of net-zero carbon emissions. Aerospace also continues to be essential to national security, humanitarian and peacekeeping efforts around the globe. We are committed to preserving the societal, security and economic benefits of our industry, safely and sustainably. </P>
<P>Advancing the future of flight and improving the world for future generations requires a multi-faceted approach. Our focus on ESG is embedded in our culture and our stakeholders’ expectations, including our current and <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 future employees, customers, regulators, suppliers, communities and investors.</P>
<H2>Environmental Stewardship</H2>
<P>To address climate change, Boeing continues to collaborate with partners across the globe on innovation and clean technology to get commercial aviation to net-zero carbon emissions. We’re finding more efficient ways for our commercial and defense customers to operate their fleets, and we’re investing heavily in sustainable aviation fuels, considered the safest and most measurable solution to reduce aviation carbon emissions over the next 20 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 to 30 years. We continue to test the latest technologies to cut emissions, reduce noise and enhance safety with our ecoDemonstrator program, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year, while investing in and demonstrating <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
alternative fuel solutions to inform the future  <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
of flight. We are committed to maintaining <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
net-zero carbon emissions within our <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 operations as we advance the design-for- environment view of our defense and  commercial products and build sustainability into every step of our product life cycle. </P>
<H2>Social Progress</H2>
<P>Our people are our most important asset. Employee safety and well-being is our priority. We have taken steps to create open, candid and respectful environments for all our teammates — not just within our four walls, but within the communities where we live and work. Boeing’s Seek, Speak &amp; Listen habits are foundational to a culture of integrity and inclusion. We’re committed to increasing the representation of women and underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities at every level of our company. And we continue to invest in our future through technical and educational organizations that inspire the next generation of aerospace innovators.  </P>
<H2>Global Engagement </H2>
<P>Most recently, our focus has been on our employees affected by the war in Ukraine. <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 As a global company with over a century in flight and a long legacy of advancing human freedom, Boeing has continuously navigated challenging and shifting geopolitical dynamics and we will continue to do so in this case, guided by our values. We have taken action and will continue to follow the lead of the U.S. Government and focus on strictly adhering to the export controls and restrictions that have <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
been announced governing work in Russia  as a baseline, while also taking additional actions. As always, our first priority is safety and the safety of our employees in Ukraine has our total focus. We also announced a significant humanitarian assistance package to support the Ukrainian people affected by the ongoing conflict. I am incredibly proud of our teammates who have made their own donations in support of Ukrainian humanitarian relief, which the company is matching through our Boeing Gift Match Program.  </P>
<H2>Transparent Governance</H2>
<P>Our Board of Directors works closely with Boeing leaders to ensure we hold ourselves to the highest standards in our work, ethical conduct and information protection. We all sign a Code of Conduct annually and commit to prioritizing safety, quality and integrity and holding one another accountable. Through the Board’s Governance &amp; Public Policy Committee, we have enhanced our practices and policies and formalized oversight of public policy, political advocacy and corporate sustainability practices — including matters related to environmental stewardship and climate change, and to diversity, equity <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 and inclusion. </P>
<P>Opportunity lies before us as we advance safe and sustainable aerospace, which is <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 critical to our commercial and defense <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
customers and to our communities at large.  I am proud of our teams as they explore innovative ways to help us continue to take <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
meaningful steps toward a more sustainable future. I invite you to join us on our journey  as we advance the future of flight together, safely and sustainably. </P>
</Sect>
<Sect><P>Boeing’s purpose is to protect, connect <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
and explore our world and beyond. We have  <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
a responsibility to do it safely, with quality, <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
integrity and sustainability. We strive to  <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
earn trust and ideally preference with our  <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
stakeholders through collaboration, humility, <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
inclusion, transparency and learning. Above <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
all else is safety. As air travel resumes around <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
the globe and workplaces change, health  and safety are always our top priority. We  will continue working across the industry  to enhance employee health and global  aerospace safety; and you will see that  addressed throughout this report. </P>
<P>Boeing established its first Chief Sustainability Officer role and formed a Global Enterprise Sustainability organization in September 2020, but that was not the beginning of our focus on sustainability. Many environmental, social and governance (ESG) elements have been part of Boeing’s fabric throughout our 106-year aerospace history, and we must always learn and continuously improve. In 1929, Bill Boeing said, “Our job is to keep everlastingly at research and experiment,<Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
to adapt our laboratories to production  as soon as practicable…to let no new improvement in flying equipment pass us by.” This philosophy endures today as we move forward and pursue sustainable aerospace with our stakeholders across Boeing’s commercial, defense and services businesses. </P>
<P>Through collaboration with our stakeholders, we learned a lot in 2021 and we see exciting opportunity going forward. While we still have more to learn, the following are a few reflections on the journey.  </P>
<H2>Our stakeholders increasingly <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 value sustainability.</H2>
<P>ESG efforts are increasingly important to <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 our current and future employees, our customers, our suppliers, our regulators, our communities and our financial stakeholders. <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
We must continue to engage and listen  <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
to them about what’s important, bring the outside in and collaborate on solutions.  <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
Last year, we described six sustainability <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
goals that will define sustainability progress <Link xml:lang="en-US">Page 12<Span>Page 12</Span>
</Link>
for Boeing and its stakeholders. This year <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 we added several waypoints and metrics <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 to measure progress (see Page 12). We  also explicitly included sustainability in our enterprise values and strategic objectives  to further embed the importance and the opportunity and, for the first time, Boeing is including compensation incentives tied to sustainability performance. </P>
<H2>The industry is committed to <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
combating climate change and it  will require collective action. </H2>
<P>Aerospace has always been about efficiency and has competed on innovation and fuel efficiency to meet customers’ expectations. Climate change and decarbonizing aerospace have further increased the urgency for progress. Airlines, defense customers, leasing companies and governments around the globe are aligning to bold climate change ambitions. We support the commercial aviation industry’s ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Boeing’s strategy to decarbonize aviation is focused <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 on four key areas: fleet renewal, operational efficiency, renewable energy transition and advanced technologies. We are engaged in studies, tests, research and partnering across these areas and the industry to learn together and provide customers with sustainable product life cycle insights and solutions to help them meet their climate change commitments.  </P>
<H2>Aerospace protects and connects; people will continue to take flight.</H2>
<P>Aerospace plays a profound role in our world and enables societal benefits. Aerospace connects and protects, and while the COVID-19 pandemic challenged the industry it also reminded us of our industry’s value. People all over the world yearned to be connected to others and global air transport delivered necessary products and goods to people’s doorsteps. Billions of passengers fly every year to connect with loved ones, explore new places and understand cultures, engage in commerce and care for those in need. Dave mentioned the industry’s vision for sustainable growth by 2050, which will require us to work, learn and solve challenges together to create future opportunities for passengers, workers and economies. At <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 the same time, aerospace continues to be essential to national security, humanitarian and peacekeeping efforts, which are social <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
responsibilities the world too often reminds <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 us remain much needed. Our industry has  a responsibility to preserve and grow the societal and economic benefits of aerospace, safely and sustainably. </P>
<H2>Partnerships, innovation and <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
learning together are critical to  our collective success.</H2>
<P>To explore and mature sustainable solutions, we must continue to work together with partners — across our communities, our industry, academia, governments and non-governmental organizations, and philanthropic foundations — given each <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
have a role to play in tackling climate change  <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
and aerospace decarbonization. In October <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
2021, we hosted a Boeing Innovation <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 Forum in Glasgow. We convened customers,  government officials, manufacturers,  academia and future talent to discuss the future of sustainable aerospace. It was an enlightening few days as expert stakeholders hosted panels on future sustainable solutions. Perhaps most inspiring was that this forum lent itself to diverse perspectives, given the <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
range of participants and talent. The First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon opened the day with inspiring remarks and announced plans for The Newton Flight Academy at Glasgow Science Center. This Boeing- supported academy is used to teach students about aviation-related STEM concepts and inspire our next generation of leaders. Boeing’s ecoDemonstrator was a popular attraction at the event. The ecoDemonstrator program celebrates its 10th anniversary this year and <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
continues to take technologies out of a lab and test them in the sky with airline and industry partners. It is perhaps one of the best and most visual representations of how innovation and partnerships are informing and maturing sustainable technologies for current and  future aircraft. </P>
<P>Boeing also participated in COP26, where the world convened to discuss climate change across all industries and on a global scale. There, the World Economic Forum, in partnership with US Special Presidential <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 Envoy for Climate John Kerry, announced the First Movers Coalition — a new platform for companies to make purchasing commitments <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
that create new market demand for low- carbon technologies. Boeing is honored to be a founding member. This is just one example of companies and governments collaborating together to advance and accelerate progress. </P>
<H2>Forward, the Future of Flight</H2>
<P>Going forward, we will remain focused on employee well-being and safety; global aviation safety; equity, diversity and inclusion; sustainable operations; innovation and clean tech; and global community engagement; among many other important elements.</P>
<P>As we look to the future of flight, aerospace innovation is energized by how to decarbonize the industry. Boeing’s strategy is focused <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 on four key areas. Continued fleet renewal with more fuel-efficient aircraft and operational efficiencies will remain critically important <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
levers to reduce carbon emissions.  Renewable energy will intersect aviation in new, exciting ways with the industrialization and growth of new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathways, technology innovation, and production volumes. SAF and the parallel research, studies and demonstrations of electric and hydrogen applications, the renewable energy total life-cycle accounting, zero climate impact aircraft design concepts, safe certification and infrastructure implications, coupled with a sustainable product life-cycle approach, will drive our industry talent, partnerships, innovation and policies going forward. It is an exciting era for aerospace. </P>
<P>These are ambitious challenges. Throughout our industry and our company history, we <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
have had the resolve and teamwork to bring  jet travel to the world and take people to the moon. We must continue to help humanity take flight in every sense while protecting our <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
planet for generations to come. As Bill Boeing also said, “We are embarked as pioneers on  a new science and industry in which our problems are so new and unusual that it behooves no one to dismiss any novel idea with the statement that ‘It can’t be done!’” </P>
<P>In that spirit, we are on a journey to solve sustainable aerospace challenges together. We appreciate our stakeholders’ partnership for shared successes as we move forward. </P>

<Sect><H2>Boeing’s Board Champions Company Values, Ethics </H2>
<P>Boeing’s Board recognizes that the company’s long-term interests are advanced when members are responsive to the concerns <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 of customers, employees, public officials, shareholders, suppliers and the communities we serve. The Board actively fosters a corporate culture that puts safety, quality, <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
integrity and sustainability at the forefront <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 of all that we do. Board members commit <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 to, and use, a Code of Ethics as guiding principles; the code emphasizes the  <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
importance of compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations; maintaining confidentiality; avoiding any conflicts of interest; and reporting of illegal or  unethical behavior. </P>
<P>The Audit Committee and the full Board oversee our compliance and ethics programs through close collaboration with Boeing’s Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) and periodic reviews of program metrics. These touchpoints provide visibility to the Board of significant compliance and ethics risks, as well as, specific cases that are identified through the company’s various reporting channels.</P>
<H2>Code of Conduct: Emphasizing the Importance of How We Do Our Work</H2>
<P>At Boeing, our first commitment is to the people and customers who rely on our products and services to protect, connect, and explore our world and beyond. Each of us has a personal responsibility to honor that promise and to serve as stewards of our company’s legacy of aerospace excellence and innovation. New employees sign <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
the Code of Conduct and complete <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
Recommitment training when they join  the company — and we all reaffirm this  commitment every year.</P>
<P>Compliance is everyone’s responsibility <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 at Boeing. Employees must hold themselves — and each other — accountable to following all rules and regulations and to doing what is right. In 2022, our Recommitment training featured real stories told by Boeing employees and company leaders that reinforced our commitment to put safety and quality above all else; to hold ourselves accountable to follow all policies and procedures; to be transparent with all stakeholders, including government regulators and customers; and to treat co-workers, customers, regulators and stakeholders with respect. It also reminded everyone of their obligation to speak up and be a voice for others when something does not align with our values.</P>
<H2>Robust Anti-Corruption Program</H2>
<P>Integrity is a core company value and Boeing strictly forbids bribery and corruption of <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 any kind. Boeing’s robust anti-corruption <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
program includes extensive controls, rigorous  policies and procedures, and an annual risk assessment to ensure effectiveness and identify potential enhancement opportunities.</P>
<P>Boeing publishes an internal policy that explains its anti-corruption and anti-bribery requirements and expectations for employees, while making its guidelines for ethical business conduct publicly available to employees and other stakeholders. The company also makes employees aware of their federally protected whistleblower rights, which are designed to protect employees against retaliation for reporting potential wrongdoing by a U.S. contractor or subcontractor.</P>
<H2>Commitments and Actions on <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 Human Rights</H2>
<P>Boeing is committed to responsible business practices and promoting positive change <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
while simultaneously creating value for  <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. In recognition of this  commitment, the company has developed policies and practices designed to enforce our Code of Basic Working Conditions and Human <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
Rights. We expect similar commitments and <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
behaviors from our suppliers, incorporate these expectations into our supplier  contracts, and verify that they are being  met through in-person engagements and third-party monitors.</P>
<H2>Efficient and Trusted <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 Reporting Mechanisms </H2>
<P>Boeing provides several confidential and anonymous reporting options for employees to report concerns, seek guidance or share ideas. Reporting channels include managers; the U.S. Domestic and International Ethics hotlines; Compliance and Ethics Officers embedded in the business; and the Speak Up website that houses online portals for employees to report issues. Retaliation against reporting parties is strictly prohibited: action is taken against violators of our anti-retaliation policies. </P>
<P>We are enhancing our ability to analyze available reporting data to identify areas of concern and understand the root cause of the problem, allowing us to promptly escalate issues to appropriate leaders and work with business partners to mitigate and address risks. The chart below demonstrates Boeing’s robust reporting culture and Boeing’s efforts to respond. Additionally, our anonymous reporting rate of 13% is lower than other published benchmarks, which suggests employees generally trust management <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
to address their concerns and do not  fear retaliation.</P>
<H2>Focus on Continuous Improvement</H2>
<P>The past few years have challenged our company like never before, reinforcing our unwavering focus on safety, quality, integrity and transparency. We recognize the need to drive continuous improvement in all that we do and in the past year have taken the following action:</P>
<P><Span>• </Span>
• Advanced our enterprise wide Safety <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
Management System (SMS), which <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 facilitates timely collection and analysis <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 of data in order to embed safety in every aspect of how we design, build and  support our products and our services.</P>
<P><Span>• </Span>
• Strengthened our Global Compliance organization and compliance program by aligning teams, revamping trainings and <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
processes, and launching new employee- focused efforts to enable compliant company performance across all of our locations around the globe.</P>
<P><Span>• </Span>
• <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
Demonstrated a commitment to promoting  a just culture grounded in humility, inclusion and transparency that protects and treats people fairly when they report safety, quality and compliance concerns.</P>
<P><Span>• </Span>
• <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
Built Seek, Speak &amp; Listen habits to <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 foster open and transparent dialogue in  all employee interactions.</P>
<P><Span>• </Span>
• Fostered a diverse, inclusive and open workplace environment that encourages teammates to voice concerns, raise issues and share ideas.</P>
<P><Span>• </Span>
• Published the Boeing Supplier Code of Conduct, which provides a clear set of expectations for suppliers doing business with Boeing, that is consistent with our policies, principles and sustainability efforts. We expect suppliers to adhere to the Boeing Supplier Code of Conduct throughout the time they do business with us and notify Boeing of any instances where expectations are not met.</P>
<P>These steps have been vital in driving <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 near-term progress and ensuring the long-term health of our company. We will continue to <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
refine and improve our program to meet <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 the needs of a dynamic business and  compliance environment.</P>
<H3>Simple Habits Drive Culture Change</H3>
<P>Over the past year, individuals, teams and leaders around the world have helped <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 build an inclusive culture of trust, care and connection, by focusing on three simple habits — Seek, Speak &amp; Listen (SS&amp;L) that guide how we work together.</P>
<P>These habits help us learn from others’ diverse perspectives, speak up about issues or ideas and listen with openness and curiosity. Embedding these habits in everything we do helps us to continuously improve, <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 build stronger teams and live our values.  </P>
<P>SS&amp;L is fundamental to who we are as a company and how we work together — 85% of team members surveyed said they use the habits in their day-to-day interactions. With this open and inclusive culture, improved business outcomes follow — in safety, quality, production, performance and inclusion. </P>
<P>By embracing these habits, we make <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 better decisions, drive innovation and build connection. We seek out the places where things aren’t going well, where anxiety may be brewing, so we can learn and address issues before they become problems; where we get all perspectives on the table and every team member feels safe to speak up; and where we listen to each other with humility. </P>
<P>We will continue to embed the habits into <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 our daily work, processes, systems and <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
communications to hold ourselves  accountable and keep moving forward.  </P>
<H2>Developing Future Leaders and Embodying Integrity</H2>
<P>In 2021, Boeing launched a new Ethics Ambassador Program designed to ensure our future leaders embody integrity, and to further connect the compliance program <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 to the business.</P>
<P>Piloted at Boeing Philadelphia in April 2021, the Ethics Ambassador Program is a leadership development program developed for Boeing employees embedded within <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 the business to amplify our values and extend the reach of the company’s Global Compliance efforts at local sites. Ethics Ambassadors serve as local advocates to encourage employees to speak up, while bringing forward localized trends to help monitor and reduce compliance risks and ensure employees adhere to the company’s Code of Conduct. </P>
<P>Boeing Philadelphia Ethics Ambassadors Christine Vasko, Tasha Silas and Ieisha Hinson each provide a friendly face for more than 4,000 local employees who have questions <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 or concerns about compliance or ethics.</P>
<P>“Employees can come to us directly, but <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 I always have my eyes and ears open for <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
pockets of anxiety that we need to look  <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
at before they potentially escalate into something problematic,” said Vasko, who  is an Engineering Manager. “Generally, we recommend that our teammates talk to </P>
<P>their manager or to our site’s compliance and ethics officer. But before doing that, we will talk things through with someone by giving them our undivided attention and asking curious, nonjudgmental questions.”</P>
<P>To date, the Ambassadors have engaged more than 2,500 teammates, sharing information about compliance and ethics via floor walks, staff meetings, diversity council and business resource group briefings, and new-employee orientation sessions. The program was recently launched at sites in Mesa, New Orleans and North Charleston with plans to expand to additional sites in <Span ActualText="

 the future.</P>

<H2>Boeing Ties Sustainability to Compensation</H2>
<P>Boeing enhanced its incentive plans as part of its full package of benefits for employees and managers in 2022 to include two new operational performance measures – one for climate and one for equity, diversity and inclusion – building on the 2021 measures of product safety, employee safety and quality. Together, these measures account for <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
25% of the total incentive with financial  performance making up the other 75%.</P>
<P>To meet the climate metric, employees <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 are challenged to reduce energy at major <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
sites by 5%, compared with a 2019  baseline, which ties to the company’s carbon <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
emissions reduction goal. Employees are <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
urged to advance diversity by having all  manager-and-above requisitions adhere <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 to 90% qualified, diverse candidates at the interview stage and by adding an absolute reduction in the percentage of direct  placements over 2021.</P>
<P>In 2021, employees and managers were motivated by completing model-based <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 engineering solution kits; completing specified design practices; reducing injuries and near-miss and hazard reporting; and improving rework percentages to support <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
a focus on product safety, employee <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 safety and quality. These efforts will  continue in 2022.</P>
<P>The 2022 annual incentive plan design is largely based on the 2021 core design, measuring both financial performance <Span ActualText="

 at the company and business unit levels <Span ActualText="

and operational performance across  the enterprise.</P>

<H2>Sustainability Governance </H2>
<P>Sustainability is rooted in Boeing’s values. <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 The Board oversees a variety of sustainability topics and in 2021, the GPP Committee charter was amended to expressly include oversight of our practices — relating to corporate sustainability, including matters related to environmental stewardship and climate change, and to diversity, equity and inclusion. Chris Raymond is Boeing’s Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), a Boeing Executive Council position reporting to Boeing’s Chief Executive Officer. As CSO, Raymond reports the progress of Boeing’s <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
sustainability objectives and stakeholder-<Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 oriented reports regularly to the GPP  Committee and the full Board.</P>
<P>Raymond is responsible for advancing <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
Boeing’s approach to sustainability,  focusing on priorities, stakeholder-oriented reporting and company performance. He leads the Global Enterprise Sustainability organization, designed to sharpen our focus on key environmental, social and governance <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
efforts through dedicated leadership alignment in these areas. Raymond’s team includes <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
a Chief Engineer who advances sustainability <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
technologies as well as future mobility <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 applications and a Global Sustainability  Policy and Partnerships leader who  strengthens our company focus on  sustainability outside the United States. </P>
<P>Reinforcing our commitment and <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 enterprise approach, a Global Sustainability Council composed of global leaders from <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
across our business units and functions <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
was established to provide executive <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 leadership, advocacy and partnership with  <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
the sustainability organization to advance <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
our objectives and strategy. This council <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
works to partner and advance sustainability <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
objectives and strategy throughout the <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 enterprise. The council also oversees  subcouncils with focuses on policy,  customers, sustainability and enterprise  services, sustainable aviation fuels, finance  and governance, and technology and  future mobility.</P>
<H2>Oversight of Political Activity</H2>
<P>Together, the Board, the GPP Committee <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 and senior leadership, are committed to ensuring that our political activities align with the company’s values, business strategies, <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
long-term shareholder interests and long- term strategic imperatives. </P>
<P>At Boeing, oversight of political activities starts at the top. The Board works closely with the Executive Vice President (EVP) of Government Operations on the oversight <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 of our engagement in the political process. This includes regular discussions about the company’s public policy priorities; the <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
company’s memberships in and payments  to trade associations and other tax-exempt organizations; Boeing Political Action Committee (BPAC) strategy and expenditures; and the company’s network of compliance procedures related to these activities. The GPP Committee leads the oversight activities on these issues and makes appropriate recommendations to the full Board about Boeing’s engagement in the political process. </P>
<P>The EVP of Government Operations also works closely with the Law and Global Compliance organization to ensure that the company’s political activities adhere to all legal requirements and company policies <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
and procedures as well as meet the highest <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
ethical standards and Boeing’s values. <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 Each year, the Company’s Compliance  Risk Management and Enterprise Risk  Management boards provide the Board with an update and overview of the effectiveness of the policies and procedures in place to ensure that the company’s political activities meet these high standards. </P>
<P>You can review the company’s oversight and internal compliance procedures for political activities <Link xml:lang="en-US">here<Span>here</Span>

<H2/>
<H2>The Board’s Oversight of Risk</H2>
<P>Boeing takes measured risks as an innovation leader. The Board and senior management avoid imprudent risks and mitigate strategic, operational and compliance risks to <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
emphasize safety, quality, integrity and  sustainability. Senior management supervises day-to-day risk management, including creating relevant policies and procedures. The Board <Span ActualText="

oversees and assesses the execution of and approach to risk management. The Board <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="

<H3>Product Safety</H3>
<P>The Aerospace Safety Committee (ASC), established in 2019, is responsible for directly overseeing engineering, design, development, manufacturing, production, operations, <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 maintenance and delivery of aerospace products and services in order to ensure the safety of our commercial, defense, space and other aerospace products and services. The ASC also consults with the Compensation <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
Committee, linking safety review and  individual executive performance.</P>
<H3>Diversity and Inclusion</H3>
<P>The Board oversees diversity and inclusion <Span ActualText="

efforts, including supervision of outreach <Span ActualText="

diversity metrics and complaints received — <Span ActualText="

and corrective actions taken — related to  behavior inconsistent with Boeing’s values.  The Board is committed to its membership’s  diversity, with 42% of directors, including the Audit, Compensation and GPP committee chairs, who represent gender, racial or ethnic diversity (as of report publication).</P>
<H3>Climate Change</H3>
<P>The Board participates in strategy <Span ActualText="

development for our products, services  and operations, including the integral environmental sustainability strategy that considers current and future impact of products and services. The Board oversees climate-related risks, goals and opportunities, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions in operations and maintaining net-zero at manufacturing and other facilities.</P>

<P>2.  Inquiries comprise Requests for Guidance and <Span ActualText="

 Information Requests. Requests for Guidance are situations where employees are seeking guidance when facing ethical dilemmas or when they need assistance in understanding company policies or expected behaviors. Information Requests are situations where employees are seeking general information.

<P>Boeing achieved net-zero carbon emissions at manufacturing sites and other facilities (Scope 1 and 2) and in its business travel (Scope 3, Category 6) in 2020 and 2021 by expanding <Span ActualText="

 the development of key technologies to further these objectives. </H2>
<P>On the products side, Boeing committed that its commercial airplanes will be capable to fly on 100% SAF by 2030. Long term, we support the commercial aviation industry’s ambition<Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 to achieve net-zero carbon emissions for global civil aviation operations by 2050. We are partnering across the industry with the goal to reimagine and ultimately decarbonize commercial <Link xml:lang="en-US">Page 41<Span>Page 41</Span>
</Link>
aviation in the second half of this century. Learn more about our plans to decarbonize commercial aviation on Page 41.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD><H2>Boeing is actively developing low-carbon transition plans to meet long-term goals with meaningful milestones. </H2>
<P>In October 2021, we announced our support for the commercial aviation industry’s ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions for global civil aviation operations by 2050. <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
By supporting this industry goal, we are addressing emissions from the use of Boeing’s sold commercial aircraft (Scope 3 Category 11) which is estimated to comprise greater than <Span>1</Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
90% of Boeing’s total GHG emissions, and therefore defined as the only relevant category of Scope 3 emissions for Boeing under the Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Benchmark.1<Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 Our <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 active support for the commercial aviation industry’s net-zero ambition largely — but not fully — aligns with the Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Indicator objective for addressing Scope 3 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
emissions. In 2021, Boeing disclosed our Scope 3 Use of Sold Product emissions for commercial aircraft, an important step toward understanding our contributions and potential <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 reduction pathways. Due to the unique aspects of our sector including global scope, long product life-span, and financial and technological decarbonization challenges, Scope 3, <Link xml:lang="en-US">Page 41<Span>Page 41</Span>
</Link>
 Category 11 emissions are best addressed as a collaborative effort across the industry. In support of a net-zero transition, the first step is to ensure we have a path that is credible and aligned with the commercial aviation industry in support of its global reduction goals. Boeing’s existing Scope 3 ambitions to support our commercial industry’s net-zero goals do not  address (i) our defense portfolio, where we are actively working with our government customers to understand and support their future requirements, or (ii) our supply chain, where we are  working with our suppliers to increase GHG reporting and proactively address climate change-driven risks to create resilience and stability within our supply base. Read more about our work to decarbonize commercial aviation on Page 41.</P>
<P>Boeing protects, connects and explores our world and beyond, safely and sustainably. We believe that safe and sustainable aerospace is an imperative for all of our stakeholders. Achieving desired decarbonization will require continued partnerships with airlines, industry, governments and research institutions over decades.

<Sect><H2>Progress on Our Equity, Diversity <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 and Inclusion Commitments</H2>
<P>Over the past year, we have seen the value inclusion brings to our global team as we continue to advance our equity, diversity and inclusion commitments. Although there is more work to be done, we are encouraged <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
by our progress, especially in light of <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 the COVID-19 pandemic and dynamic  business environment. </P>
<P>In 2021, women and racial/ethnic minority representation at Boeing increased overall as compared with the prior year. And, in the second half of 2021, exit rates for women, men and teammates of all races were within 0.1 point of one another, meaning the rate of people exiting was relatively equal among race and gender. For the first time, we shared data related to women of color, disability, gender identity and sexual orientation.</P>
<P>In 2021, we established a set of near-term aspirations that we are striving to achieve by 2025 and introduced the Seek, Speak &amp; Listen habits to build stronger teams and <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 drive better business outcomes. While we are moving in the right direction, we want — and <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
need — to accelerate change. In the spirit  of Seek, Speak &amp; Listen, we will continue seeking out and listening to ensure that we foster a culture of belonging and inclusion. </P>
<P>With nearly 142,000 team members across the U.S. and in over 65 countries, we remain committed to recruiting, supporting and developing diverse talent. </P>
<H2>Inspiring the Next Generation to Build the Future</H2>
<P>Through his leadership both inside and outside of Boeing, Ted Colbert, CEO of Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security, is developing <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 the next generation of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) leaders <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
and making Boeing — and the communities  in which we operate — more inclusive. </P>
<P>His efforts were recognized earlier this year when he was awarded the 2022 Black Engineer of the Year Award, a prestigious award recognizing a public or private sector leader who has expanded opportunities for African Americans in STEM. </P>
<P>“Boeing’s commitment to equity, diversity and inclusion is first and foremost about treating each other with respect while acknowledging differences at the same time. When we not only recognize but also respectfully accept how race, gender, ability, age and life experience affect the perspective people bring to challenges and opportunities, we improve the way we innovate and problem solve together,” said Colbert upon receiving the accolade.  </P>
<P>From championing employee resource groups to supporting Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Colbert’s leadership has made a profound impact on shaping Boeing’s diversity and inclusion initiatives. <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 A member of the Racial Equity Task Force, Colbert has advocated for increasing Black <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
employee representation at Boeing in the  U.S. by 20% and spearheaded Boeing partnerships with minority-focused STEM programming and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, the nation’s largest organization representing the Black college community. </P>
<H2>Racial Equity Task Force Celebrates Progress</H2>
<P>Boeing’s Racial Equity Task Force was established as a think tank, to elevate and amplify the voices of our workforce. The team has worked to advance Boeing’s action plan to root out racism, advance progress on key measures of equity and inclusion, and strengthen the company’s commitment <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 to community investments and diverse suppliers.</P>
<P>The Racial Equity Task Force has partnered with Boeing’s Global Equity, Diversity &amp; Inclusion team to engage thousands of employees; strengthen the Black experience; help employees identify and interrupt bias; improve retention; <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 and disrupt the perception that equity, diversity and inclusion are optional parts of our culture. </P>
<P>“The task force has worked to drive change by incorporating feedback from our stakeholders to outline a path forward for combating racial injustice and building a culture of inclusion and racial equity,” said Paris Forest, Senior Director of Boeing Information Technology &amp; Data Analytics and co-chair of the Racial Equity Task Force.</P>
<P>Recommendations from this team, derived from listening to employees from across the company, have been elevated as priorities for the company and include improved ethics and HR processes, further enforcement of the company’s anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policies, tying <Span ActualText="

 <Span ActualText="

By implementing an Autism at Work program <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 first piloted at a U.S.-based Boeing site,  European teammates are improving  neurodiverse hiring practices locally.</P>
<P>In 2021, a Boeing Philadelphia team brought the talents of neurodivergent people to the company through the Autism at Work program. Traditional hiring selection processes may overlook strengths and unduly emphasize weaknesses of neurodivergent people, who are often unemployed or underemployed. <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 The Autism at Work program draws on and develops the capabilities of college students <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
with autism by providing work experiences <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
and learning opportunities while they finish  their degrees. After graduation, many are  hired as part of Boeing’s workforce.</P>
<P>Scaling the Autism at Work program helps Boeing teams worldwide to replicate and customize best practices in neurodiverse hiring. </P>
<P>“The Philadelphia team’s successful pilot program guided our efforts locally,” said Maja Tomczak, Engineering Manager for Boeing AvionX in Poland.</P>
<P>To grow and sustain inclusion of <Span ActualText="

neurodivergent communities, the Poland <Span ActualText="

<H2>Apprenticeships Shape the Future Workforce</H2>
<P>Boeing is addressing the skilled-talent shortage with an innovative program to find underrepresented and nontraditional candidates motivated to acquire the skills to win the <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 digital revolution. </P>
<P>In mid-2021, Boeing’s Learning &amp; Development experts brainstormed ways to combat hiring pressures from the COVID-19 pandemic and retiring baby boomers. College graduates were not providing the candidate volumes or skills needed for the latest technologies. </P>
<P>Boeing’s Technical Apprenticeship Program (BTAP) was born <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 to address this skill shortage and shape the future workforce. BTAP creates a high-quality career pathway for a diverse pool of candidates for cybersecurity, software engineering, data analysis and other jobs.</P>
<P>“We are addressing shortages while bringing powerful new perspectives to our business from diverse skill sets and talent, which will strengthen our technical ecosystem,” said Michael Fors, Boeing Learning &amp; Development. “The socioeconomic impact will provide disrupted workers access to family-wage jobs while reducing pay inequity.” </P>
<P>Boeing is committed to placing at least 1,000 technical apprentices into highly-skilled technical roles by 2025, as it scales up this innovative program. The first BTAP cohort <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 began in April 2022. </P>
<H2>Learning Together Demonstrates Success </H2>
<P>Since early 2021, over 2,100 Boeing employees have completed degree and certificate programs using the Learning Together Program, our industry leading tuition assistance benefit, which provides generous funding at all levels and teammates can apply the educational benefit toward more than 300 colleges and universities globally.</P>
<H2>Holistic Approach Grows Gender Equity in Our Trades Workforce</H2>
<P>Boeing Aerostructures Australia is addressing the challenge of recruiting and retaining women in traditionally male-dominated talent pools of engineering, IT and mechanical trades.</P>
<P>Boeing is partnering with organizations, such as Women in Aviation, to introduce a four-year apprenticeship program <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
that supports women’s engagement in aerospace skills  or engineering. Growing a diverse and gender-equitable workforce is central to our business model.</P>
<P>The approach extends beyond developing practical skills to well-being, safety and belonging, across the following pillars:</P>
<P>Attract: Partnering with Aviation/Aerospace Australia, an independent nonprofit association focused on the long-term health and sustainability of Australia’s aviation sector, providing micro-credential courses to women interested in a career <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 in aviation.</P>
<P>Recruit: Working with an organization that promotes, supports, connects and encourages females in nontraditional roles and trades. </P>
<P>Retain: Engaging with an organization to deliver a tailored, respectful workplace training program, which incorporates feedback from former BAA apprentices and trade-qualified female employees, as well as aligns with BAA’s diversity and inclusion goals.</P>
<H2>Educating Employees on Sustainability</H2>
<P>Boeing launched a series of online, self-guided, digital learning modules providing a view into our sustainability vision and strategy, called the <Link xml:lang="en-US">Aerospace Sustainability Foundations Training</Link>
Aerospace Sustainability Foundations Training<Span ActualText="

. The training also informs employees about sustainable behavior changes at work, at home and in our communities.  All employees are encouraged to set aside an hour to earn the learning and development badge. </P>

<Sect><P>Boeing knows that operating to keep ourselves and our teammates safe in the workplace is everyone’s responsibility. Safety is central to everything we do for ourselves, those we care about and our communities.</P>
<H2>Leveraging Technology to Improve Workplace Safety</H2>
<P>For over a century, Boeing has empowered employees <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
to incorporate the latest technology into production  processes. This increases workplace safety, quality and efficiency simultaneously. </P>
<P>Through automation and robotics, Boeing has greatly enhanced workplace safety and reduced employee exposure to some high hazards. Serious injuries significantly decreased by 27% from 83 in 2020 to 61 in 2021.<Span>1</Span>
1 Currently, the majority of workplace injuries are ergonomic. This is another key area <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
where Boeing is improving designs and using technology  to safeguard against injuries. </P>
<P>“We’ve worked to make advancements to the equipment <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
we use daily by developing ergonomically designed tools  and other equipment,” said Erik Pham, Boeing Environment, Health &amp; Safety Senior Director. “We also use exoskeleton technology to help protect our employees in a variety of ways, such as repetitive motion stress injuries and overhead work. Over 200 units have been deployed and are being used <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
throughout Commercial Airplanes programs. Qualitative benefits were immediately realized as data is being collected  to evaluate quantitative benefits. These wearable technologies target repetitive motion that could cause ergonomic issues and, by alleviating some of that burden off the user, minimizes some risks and injuries.”</P>
<P>Pham said the company goes beyond regulatory compliance and leverages technology to mitigate or prevent workplace safety risks and injuries. Boeing is working toward incorporating sensor technology and augmented reality into the workplace. Technology is instrumental in preventing fatalities and in reducing serious and ergonomic injuries. It’s tangible evidence of Boeing’s prioritized values of safety, quality, integrity and sustainability.</P>

<H2>Innovative Care Options Support Employees Through the Pandemic </H2>
<P>As the COVID-19 pandemic continued through the entirety <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
of 2021, Boeing employees and their families, as with <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 communities across the globe, faced numerous challenges  to their physical and emotional well-being. To address these challenges, Boeing introduced innovative programs in the U.S. to provide employees with the care they needed, when and where they needed it. </P>
<P>Building on an existing platform of physical and emotional coaching services, Boeing added access to virtual primary care, behavioral health and musculoskeletal support for those employees who prefer to take advantage of care from the safety and convenience of their homes — at no cost in 2021. With increased demand for behavioral health services, confidential video-based visits with a coach or therapist for anxiety, depression, grief, self-confidence and medication management proved to be particularly valuable during the pandemic. </P>
<P>In addition, to help busy parents and other caregivers, Boeing doubled the number of back-up child and adult/elder care days subsidized by the company to 20 days per eligible employee per year. Back-up care may be used when a regular caregiver is unavailable — all too common during <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 the pandemic — and the employee needs to work.</P>
<H2>Boeing Expands Benefits to Include <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 Domestic Partners</H2>
<P>Employees said that Boeing could be doing more to support <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
its diverse workforce. And they were right. Our actions  <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
as a company need to reflect our values, which means supporting not only our employees, but also the people  most important to them.</P>
<P>Effective June 1, 2021, Boeing expanded eligibility for certain benefits to cover all qualifying domestic partners of U.S. employees. These benefits include features of the company’s health, life and accident insurance programs, as well as retirement, relocation and leave of absence benefits.</P>
<P>New domestic partner benefits include the following: </P>
<P>Employees are able to cover their domestic partner and their domestic partner’s eligible children under their health care plan.</P>
<P>An employee may request a leave of absence to take care of their domestic partner or dependents of a domestic partner with a serious health condition.</P>
<P>Pension plan participants can elect a joint and survivor payment option with their domestic partner as the beneficiary. </P>
<P>This change was made as part of our ongoing effort to create a more inclusive work environment where everyone is respected and feels valued. The company also believes that extending these benefits to employees in domestic partnerships will <Span ActualText="

 allow us to attract and retain the best team and talent.</P>

 <Span ActualText="

of employees and maintain business  continuity. As vaccines became available, <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 we encouraged employees to get vaccinated, followed government requirements, provided resources and support, offered paid time  off for vaccinations, and supported several injection clinics for employees and their families. We provided access to virtual primary care physicians and behavioral health clinicians at no cost for employees in the U.S. and various global locations. We continued virtual work options, with many employees telecommuting. We maintained safety protocols at our sites, including face coverings, <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
physical distance and enhanced cleaning requirements. We continued daily self-health checks and operated a phone line to allow <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
employees to promptly report positive COVID-19 test results directly to Boeing.  As part of that reporting process, we managed a robust contact-tracing program to identify those who had been in close contact in  the workplace with employees who tested positive for COVID-19.</P>
<H2>Employees and Their Families Find Success With Free Tutoring Program </H2>
<P>Leah Lenzner’s daughter was in the first grade and falling behind her classmates in reading skills when Leah decided to jump <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
on a new program offered at Boeing: tutoring  for students. </P>
<P>Boeing started offering free tutoring in early 2021 to support employees in response to the challenges many families were facing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through Boeing’s partnership with Bright Horizons, Varsity Tutors offers educational tutoring for children in grades K-12 including virtual private tutoring, small group academic support, personalized action plans to meet academic goals, and support for children <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 with functional needs. Eligible U.S. employees can receive up to 80 hours of company-paid tutoring per year.</P>
<P>Lenzner, a strength analyst on the T-7A program, contacted Varsity Tutors and enrolled her daughter, where she was matched with a reading specialist. By the <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 end of the school year, Leah’s daughter moved up in her reading level, so they decided to continue the tutoring during the summer. When her daughter started second grade, she was at the appropriate reading level for her grade. </P>
<P>Leah recommends the tutoring program to other Boeing employees, citing the ease in scheduling the service and the benefit it provides to children. </P>
<P>“The tutors know what they are doing,” Lenzner said. “They knew how to help her <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
by offering teaching that was targeted to  what she needed.” </P>
<H2>Polish Employees Help Colleagues Flee Ukraine </H2>
<P>Poland has received more than 3 million refugees from Ukraine, more than all other countries combined. Employees from all three Boeing sites in Poland have helped colleagues from Kyiv find safe shelter and amenities, with all the means to continue their work.</P>
<P>“I thank all our colleagues for their truly outstanding display of humanity,” said Rafal Stepnowski, head of Government Relations at Boeing Poland. </P>
<P>How Boeing Employees Helped Each Other:</P>
<P><Span>• </Span>
• Initiated employee aid efforts from Polish sites in Gdansk, Warsaw and Rzeszow when the crisis emerged and continue to respond to needs as they emerge.</P>
<P><Span>• </Span>
• Enrolled schoolchildren, found COVID-19 boosters and sourced veterinarians for pets.</P>
<P><Span>• </Span>
• Transformed a former gym in Gdansk (Northern Poland) into a room filled with supplies for colleagues from Ukraine, offering everything from hygiene products and clothes to strollers and children’s games. </P>
<P><Span>• </Span>
• Purchased and collected essentials in Gdansk, where supplies were still available, and then drove eight hours south in a rented car to deliver them to Rzeszów, near the Ukrainian border.</P>
<P><Span>• </Span>
• Provided warm meals to refugees via a Boeing Warsaw employee, who drove to the border with her family food truck to serve refugees waiting in line. Colleagues supplied the necessary provisions, cleaning supplies and dishes.</P>
<P><Span>• </Span>
• <Span ActualText="

<P>How Boeing Assisted Employees in Need:</P>
<P><Span>• </Span>
• Providing resources via the Employee <Span ActualText="

<Sect><H2>The Key to Boeing’s Product Life Cycle</H2>
<P>From a customer’s initial request to the creation of the aircraft or product to its use and eventual retirement, every stage along the way can be engineered with Earth and all its inhabitants in mind. This is Boeing’s life-cycle approach: Design, build and deliver each of its products and services with the highest standards of safety, quality, integrity and sustainability. Digital solutions span many aspects of our product life cycle. </P>
<P>Boeing’s product life-cycle strategy centers around creating <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 a product with its own end of life taken into account. These examples demonstrate how Boeing technology is sustaining and maintaining fleets and accelerating product life-cycle <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
development from design to production to use — all the  time supporting customer’s efficiency needs.</P>
<H2>Materials and Use </H2>
<H3>MQ-25 Stingray: Mission and Design Efficiency Leads <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 the Way </H3>
<P>Efficiency is a founding principle for the MQ-25 Stingray, the U.S. Navy’s first uncrewed aerial refueler. Instead of diverting F/A-18 Super Hornets from their fighter mission to refuel other carrier aircraft, the MQ-25 — with its highly efficient commercial engine and lightweight composite skins — will be able to stay in the air much longer, using little fuel itself to complete its mission. </P>
<P>“Efficiency is part of the mission, but it’s also part of our design and production philosophy,” said Jim Young, Boeing MQ-25 Chief Engineer. MQ-25 is a digitally native aircraft, with 3D models of every structure and system. Even their performance is modeled, which helps predict operations and sustainment. </P>
<P>“Using the models — and validating them over more than 120 flight-test hours and three refueling flights — has accelerated our confidence in this design and helped us identify improvements much earlier than traditional programs,” said Young.</P>
<P>The efficiency thread continues through MQ-25 production, where advanced manufacturing techniques eliminate the need for drilling during aircraft assembly. </P>
<P>“As a result, our mechanics are holding digital tablets — not drills — that guide the assembly process,” Young said. “It’s not only safer and more ergonomic, but also helps increase quality and reduce foreign object debris. It’s all part of supporting the Navy’s air wing of the future.”</P>
<H2>Uncrewed Aircraft Manufacturing Technology Rises to Sustainability Challenge</H2>
<P>Safe and sustainable manufacturing technology developed for Boeing’s commercial airplanes has transitioned to improving efficiency of the Airpower Teaming System (ATS), the first military aircraft designed, developed and manufactured in Australia in over 50 years.</P>
<P>“Our team leverages several advanced technologies, including additive manufacturing, to produce the aircraft structures in the most efficient manner,” said Phil Crothers, Affordability and Technology Integration, ATS.  </P>
<P>Many of the resulting flyaway parts are made from <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 composites — carbon-fiber reinforced plastic combined with an advanced resin-infusion process — which are much lighter than the more commonly used metallics, thereby reducing <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
fuel use and emissions. Excess and end-of-life composite <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 material can be recycled into laptop cases, car parts,  rail-car undercarriages and other products.</P>
<P>“To evaluate the benefits of these measures and to uncover where we can strive further, we are conducting research<Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 to address the full life-cycle impact of materials used in the <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
aircraft,” said Crothers. “This is an essential part of our  commitment to sustainability transparency.” </P>

<H2>Using Data to Improve C–17 Readiness and <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 Reduce Costs </H2>
<P>Deploying predictive technology in the area of fleet <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 sustainment is a maintenance game-changer. Through the Boeing Aircraft Data Reasoner (ADR), C-17 airlifter service teams are identifying concerns before they become issues. </P>
<P>Starting in 2015, the ADR system has been a part of operations for several of Boeing’s global defense customers. </P>
<P>“We have seen proven results utilizing the data collected <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 by the ADR,” said Brian Hansen, C-17 Digital Engineering Services Manager at Boeing. “The ADR enables customers to be proactive with data rather than waiting for something to happen.”</P>
<P>The ADR records over 65,000 parameters while executing approximately 36,000 sensor-based algorithms. The derived analytics enable data-driven decisions for C-17 operations by minimizing unscheduled repairs, reducing troubleshooting times and supporting crew training and safety initiatives, <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 all while aligning with CBM+ principles.</P>
<P>Hansen said the ADR has also positively affected <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 sustainability results by saving customers over 4.5 million pounds (2 million kilograms) of fuel and over 28,000 maintenance hours over a six-year time frame. In addition, the ADR provided over 1,100 maintenance recommendations and mitigated over 17,000 non-mission-capable hours. </P>
<P>“We owe it to our customers to keep the C-17 flying as efficiently as possible. ADR enables us to do just that,” <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 said Hansen.</P>

<H2>Emissions Reporter: Air Astana <Span ActualText="

 Case Study</H2>
<P>With a complex emissions-reporting process and a busy operation, employees at Air <Span ActualText="

 Astana, the flag carrier of Kazakhstan, used to spend hours manually sorting data and <Span ActualText="

filling out forms to report on their annual  carbon dioxide emissions for every single flight to ensure accurate reporting. </P>
<P>Since adopting the Boeing Emissions Reporter (ER) solution in 2021, all that has changed.</P>
<P>Air Astana required a solution that automates the data sorting process and generates ready-to-use reports with clearly displayed results, reducing time spent on repetitive tasks that could otherwise be used for deeper analysis or completing other projects. ER’s tailored and automated data validation <Span ActualText="

<Sect><P>The societal benefits of aerospace are immense. It protects and connects people, enables livelihoods and cargo, provides humanitarian relief and national security and allows for human exploration of space. In 2019, 4.5 billion people flew, $7 trillion in goods were exchanged and the aviation industry supported 87.7 million jobs (Aviation Benefits Beyond Borders). Air Transport Action Group analysis predicts that by 2050 air travel will carry over 10 billion passengers a year, support 180 million jobs and generate nearly $9 trillion in economic activity.</P>
<P>The aviation industry also created 900 million tons of <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 carbon emissions in 2019, which is about 2% of the world’s emissions and ~12% of transportation’s emissions. As we look to create a sustainable future of flight, we are united with our customers and governments around the globe in establishing bold climate change goals and supporting civil aviation’s ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. </P>
<P>To ensure the benefits of aerospace remain available for generations to come, we have work to do. We’ve made great strides since the beginning of the jet age, but our greatest accomplishments are yet to come. In creating the future of flight, Boeing is focused on four key areas to decarbonize aviation. Throughout this section of the report, you will find examples of how Boeing is putting this strategy to work. </P>
<H2>Boeing and Etihad — Pioneering Sustainability Solutions Together</H2>
<P>Boeing and Etihad Airways extended their partnership in November 2021, focusing on improving the efficiency of navigation and flight operations. The agreement builds upon the Etihad-dubbed “Greenliner program” that has utilized 787s to test new, sustainable operations since the original partnership launched in 2019.</P>
<P>In past years, an Etihad 787 has served as the Boeing ecoDemonstrator platform, while the airline has been at the forefront of incorporating SAF into its fleet. This includes using SAF on 787 delivery flights and revenue flights, where Etihad has pioneered new approaches in developing a more sustainable network.  </P>
<H2>Boeing and CSIRO Launch New 5-Year, AU$41M R&amp;D Program</H2>
<P>Boeing and CSIRO, Australia’s national science agency, <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 have launched a five-year, AU$41 million ($29.5 million) research-and-development program to boost manufacturing safety and productivity and to improve aviation sustainability.</P>
<P>Building on a 32-year partnership, the program aims to advance sustainable aviation solutions that deliver on the great challenge of lowering emissions while expanding the global economy.</P>
<P>Projects include accelerating satellite communications and other space-related technologies and enhancing Boeing’s digital twin and model-based engineering capabilities. These initiatives will further improve the operational efficiency and sustainability of Boeing’s commercial, government and defense products.</P>

<H2>Advancing Sustainable Aviation Fuel </H2>
<P>Managing the various blends of sustainable aviation fuel <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 (SAF) for Boeing’s commercial operations is no easy feat for fuel truck driver Terry Garl. Garl is a vital part of the Boeing Licensed Transportation fueling team that coordinates the storage and distribution of three different types of SAF at <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
Seattle’s Boeing Field — the 100% SAF, a 50/50 blend  (half SAF, half conventional jet fuel) used for the Boeing ecoDemonstrator program and a 30/70 blend previously reserved for delivery flights by customer request, in addition to various types of conventional jet fuel. </P>
<P>When Boeing signed a deal to purchase 2 million gallons of SAF from EPIC Fuels for its commercial airplane operations <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 for 2022, the largest announced SAF procurement by an airframer, Garl’s job became a bit easier. </P>
<P>“We used to have to take our SAF deliveries and segregate them into a fuel truck,” said Garl. “Now with this large of a shipment, it goes straight into the fuel farms at each site. <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 So any airplane being fueled at Boeing Field could get SAF in its tank.”  </P>
<P>By 2030, all commercial airplanes Boeing delivers will be capable to fly on 100% SAF — that was the commitment we made in January 2021. Keeping that promise requires steady progress and strong partnerships. Boeing is forging ahead with other stakeholders to advance this drop-in replacement for conventional jet fuel.</P>
<P>A key challenge of SAF is creating commercial-scale production of price-competitive supplies. Producing this level of SAF globally will require significant investment <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
and policy changes. To address these challenges,  Boeing announced a partnership with SkyNRG on scaling the availability and use of SAF globally, including an investment in SkyNRG’s SAF production project.</P>

<H2>Sustainable Aviation Fuel Development <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 is a Team Sport</H2>
<P>No one entity can decarbonize aviation alone, so Boeing provided technical support for SAF flights with two customers on board 737 MAXs and for Rolls-Royce’s 100% SAF flight with its 747 test bed. In December, several Boeing leaders boarded a United Airlines 737-8 in Chicago for the first-ever passenger flight on 100% SAF in one engine. They flew to Washington, D.C., on 500 gallons (1,900 liters) of 100% SAF in one engine and an equivalent volume of conventional jet fuel in the other.</P>
<P>“United continues to lead from the front when it comes to climate change action,” United CEO Scott Kirby said on the day of the historic flight. “Today’s SAF flight is not only a significant milestone for efforts to decarbonize our industry, <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 but when combined with the surge in commitments to produce and purchase alternative fuels, we’re demonstrating the scalable and impactful way companies can join together and play a role in addressing the biggest challenge of our lifetimes.” </P>
<P>SAF advancements in aviation can happen on the ground as well. In late 2021, Boeing entered into a long-term partnership with the NASA Langley Research Center to test SAF emissions. The two aerospace pioneers joined forces to collect and analyze SAF emissions on the ground from the 2021 Boeing ecoDemonstrator, an Alaska Airlines 737-9. The testing included a flight with 100% SAF in one engine and conventional jet fuel in the other. The data collected thus far is consistent with the expectations of the benefits of the renewable fuel. Working with our industry partners, Boeing is conducting the research not only to make our commercial airplanes 100% SAF-capable, but also to better understand all aspects of <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 SAF and how it will improve aviation sustainability. </P>

<P>The 2021 Boeing ecoDemonstrator leaned into the program’s mission — innovate, collaborate, accelerate. Since 2012, the ecoDemonstrator has tested over 200 technologies in a flying laboratory, enabling engineers to gain knowledge faster. Our collaboration with airlines, suppliers, government agencies and academia allows those learnings to be shared. Both accelerate the path to products, services and production <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 for a more sustainable aerospace future.</P>
<P>“One of the best parts the ecoDemonstrator program is sharing the innovative work we do with others,” said Program Manager Rae Lutters. “Collaboration with industry partners <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
is a key component of the program and Boeing’s strategy <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 to decarbonize aviation. Alaska Airlines was instrumental  in making this year’s program a success.”  </P>
<P>Boeing and Alaska Airlines partnered on the 2021 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
ecoDemonstrator program using one of the airline’s new  737 MAX airplanes. In addition to its test flights, it flew to Anchorage, Alaska; Washington, D.C.; San Francisco; Glasgow, Scotland; and the Dubai Airshow — all on a 50/50 blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and conventional jet fuel, which is the current maximum allowable blend for commercial flights. </P>
<P>“Alaska Airlines flies to some of the most beautiful places in the world and we care deeply about ensuring the communities, lands and natural habitats where we live and fly are strong and healthy for the long haul,” said Diana Birkett Rakow, Alaska Airlines Senior Vice President of Public Affairs &amp; Sustainability. </P>
<P>In 2021, 20 new technologies were tested that can reduce fuel use and noise, enhance safety and operational efficiency, and incorporate more sustainable materials. Those technologies include an acoustic lining inside the engine nacelle that reduces noise. Boeing and Alaska Airlines partnered with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on sensors that measure greenhouse gas emissions. Engineers conducted ground tests on a fire-extinguishing agent intended to replace Halon 1301. We also tested cabin interior sidewalls made from recycled carbon composite fiber, a by-product of our own production. The sidewalls can reduce noise and waste going <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 to landfills and are lighter than the panels they replaced.</P>
<P>This was the eighth airplane to serve as a flying test bed <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 for the ecoDemonstrator program, which will celebrate its 10-year anniversary this year.</P>
<H2>Propelling the Future of Aerospace </H2>
<P>The future of flight will take into account the latest digital design, test and production tools, airframe, and propulsion and systems technology. Boeing is at the forefront of informing the future of aerospace and  understanding how alternative power and energy solutions such as hydrogen and electrification systems will apply across market segments and missions. </P>
<P>We need green hydrogen — generated<Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 using electrolysis powered by renewable electricity — to produce SAF. Beyond using hydrogen for SAF, the industry is considering using it as an energy carrier on board an aircraft. Boeing has innovated with hydrogen <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
and fuel cell applications onboard aircraft for  over 15 years. We have developed insights through five flight demonstration programs with crewed and uncrewed aircraft using hydrogen fuel cells and combustion engines. We also have substantial experience with hydrogen and especially cryogenic storage systems from our space and launch business.</P>
<H3>Performing Under Pressure </H3>
<P>In late 2021, Boeing and the Defense <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
conducted testing on a new type of large,  <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
fully composite, linerless cryogenic fuel tank, designed and manufactured by Boeing.  It passed a series of burst tests at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, validating the tank’s composite materials and fabrication methods and signifying that the technology is mature, ready and reliable for use in aerospace vehicles — in space and in the air.   </P>
<P>While this particular cryotank was designed for space applications, the lessons learned from this testing campaign, along with our previous hydrogen demonstration flight-test programs, mark an important leap in materi<Span ActualText="­">-</Span>
-als technology for sustainable aviation. The 30-foot (9-meter) tank has the capacity to hold 16,000 gallons (60,600 liters) of liquid hydrogen, the energy equivalent of about 3,700 gallons (14,000 liters) of Jet A fuel, which is typical of a regional jet-sized airplane. Using hydrogen aboard a commercial aircraft can eliminate in-flight carbon emissions, which has exciting potential. But it also introduces a number of important engineering and life-cycle sustainability challenges that Boeing continues <Link xml:lang="en-US">Read more here.<Span>Read more here.</Span>

<H3>Sustainable: Boeing Advances Transonic Truss-Braced Wing Concept</H3>
<P>Boeing is advancing the design of the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing (TTBW) concept, which has the potential to make future airplanes more aerodynamic and environmentally sustainable. Under this configuration, fuel efficiency is estimated to improve by 9%. It is also designed to offer unprecedented aerodynamic efficiency while flying at Mach 0.80 — consistent with the current speed of commercial air travel. In partnership with NASA under the Sustainable Flight Demonstrator and the Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research programs, Boeing is continuing to research and develop the TTBW concept before it is evaluated for future Boeing aircraft. </P>
<H3>Improving First-Time Quality: Cracking Down on Defects</H3>
<P>Welding is a fabrication process used to fuse together two or more parts with heat, pressure or both, forming a join as the parts cool. When welding aluminum, heat affected zone (HAZ) cracking can occur due to a number of variables. When this happens, it leads to significant rework. This affects quality, causing part supply and production impacts and adding cost. </P>
<P>A cross-functional team of Boeing engineers and mechanics wanted to tackle this chronic problem, so they performed a robust root-cause analysis to identify all contributing factors. Based on the findings, they documented and implemented a <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
new standard work and procedures process. Subsequently,  <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
all Boeing mechanics and welders were trained on the new procedures, welding equipment was evaluated and tested <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 to optimize machine settings, and additional part-cleaning measures were put in place prior to assembly to reduce the likelihood of HAZ defects. </P>
<P>Thanks to this committed team, HAZ cracking has been reduced by over 35% each month, improving quality and efficiency and saving tens of thousands of dollars per month. </P>
<H3>Design Insights: New Livery Inkjet-Printing Process <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 Could Offer Advantages</H3>
<P>Boeing teams from across the globe worked together to adapt inkjet-printing technology to create photorealistic <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
airplane liveries by precisely applying billions of dots of ink  to curved surfaces using a rotatable, eight-axis print head. </P>
<P>“This new inkjet printing process takes our aircraft livery and image-design efforts to the next level,” said Chip Frohlich, Director of Advanced Manufacturing for Commercial Airplanes Product Development. “If the customer can imagine it, <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 we will be able to deliver it — from solid colors to photos. Eventually, we could operate it similarly to a car wash, without the multiple passes and cure cycles needed with traditional paint. Not only can the results be far more creative, but we also will have faster turnaround times and reduced costs.” </P>
<P>Traditionally, it takes three to 12 production days to paint liveries. With inkjet printing, the time required for image application will be reduced to just a couple of days, even for complex designs, plus safety is improved by minimizing work <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 at heights. It also provides better aerodynamics in flight, thanks <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
to the elimination of paint steps and edges. In addition, with  the reduction of up to 100 pounds (45 kilograms) of weight resulting from multiple paint layers being replaced by a single thin layer of ink, fuel efficiency is enhanced.</P>
<P>The technology is still in development and is not yet available to customers, but is showing great promise as a simpler and more environmentally preferred process. </P>

Quality: Early Involvement Sets  the Stage</H2>
<P>The best way to achieve quality is by <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 incorporating it into products and services from the beginning of design. Quality fuels sustainability by evaluating and improving efficiency, reducing waste and improving management processes.</P>
<P>For years, design and proposal teams in Phantom Works — a Boeing organization that innovates the next generation of aerospace and defense solutions — have been using Early Quality Involvement (EQI) methods and tools to ensure that quality is incorporated from the start. This helps to identify quality issues, concerns and risks that may surface and to prevent them from happening.</P>
<P>With Phantom Works’ success, teams are <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 replicating EQI across Defense, Space &amp; Security (BDS). BDS Total Quality is driving EQI methods and tools across BDS and integrates <Span ActualText="

them into the Enterprise Standard Gated <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 Process by which development programs  are shepherded from initial concepts through deployment. All BDS Total Quality employees are asked to take a 10-minute trainer on EQI.</P>
<P>The EQI Toolset lays out a series of checklists and templates for program managers and others to follow as they pass through the first stages of new-product development, helping them identify crucial issues that could crop up and plan ahead for them, said Clark Rucker, Manager of BDS Integrated Quality. Rucker served on the Phantom Works Quality team when EQI was designed.</P>
<P>“The intent of EQI, then and now, is not to correct quality issues, but to avoid them in the first place,” Rucker said. </P>
<H2>Strengthening System Drives <Span ActualText="

Higher Quality in Building and  Delivering Products</H2>
<P>The Boeing Quality Management System (QMS) is an established business management system meant to ensure customer, regulatory and business requirements are met. In 2021, the company continued to strengthen its system through application of the One Boeing Production System and lean principles, using new industry assessment tools and operating in alignment with a Safety Management <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 System (SMS). QMS and SMS work together and are built into the company’s organizational policies, processes, procedures and resources. They are intended to enable teams to make a perfect copy — conforming and safe — every time. The Boeing QMS is based on AS9100, the internationally recognized and premier aerospace QMS standard. Like other major <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
aerospace manufacturers, Boeing flows  down AS9100 certification and compliance requirements to its suppliers to build a quality <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
foundation that enables effective and efficient processes that meet multiple customer,  regulatory and business requirements.</P>
<H2>Getting it Right the First Time – Safe and Clean</H2>
<P>The Boeing Production System (BPS) is the framework by which Boeing uses standards and problem solving to continually improve its production system. The goal is zero safety incidents, zero foreign object debris (FOD) and 100% first-pass quality. Teammates can expect a safe place to work, the right tools, training and materials, timely feedback and recognition, and ways to raise concerns and get the help they need. </P>
<P>By learning, adopting and maturing the BPS standards across our global enterprise, we foster the predictability and discipline neces<Span ActualText="­">-</Span>
-sary to operate with excellence and deliver results with first-time quality. As we apply lean principles and take steps to eliminate waste in every aspect of our business, we need to determine not only how to solve the problems that arise, but also how to prevent them from happening again.</P>
<P>BPS contributes to sustainability by improving efficiency, reducing waste and improving<Span ActualText="

management of climate-related risks and opportunities is provided on Page 15 of this report. </P>
<P>To achieve our goals related to the climate and to greenhouse gases (GHG), we actively monitor emissions, fuel use and energy efficiency. We have set targets for performance in each of these areas. As part of Boeing’s robust business continuity program, we also monitor the length and severity <Span ActualText="

<H2>Net-Zero at Manufacturing and Facilities </H2>
<P>Boeing achieved net-zero carbon emissions at manufacturing and other facilities and in business travel in 2021 for the second consecutive year, by expanding conservation and renewable energy use while securing verified offsets for the remaining greenhouse gas emissions. </P>
<P>Since 2008, Boeing has voluntarily and transparently reported greenhouse gas emissions from our operations in annual CDP disclosures. In 2021, CDP awarded Boeing a climate change grade of B; C for water security.  </P>
<P>Boeing’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategy <Span ActualText="

 emissions reduction and energy conservation and to play  an active role in achieving these goals. </P>
<P>Enterprise greenhouse gas emissions from operations are calculated after the conclusion of the reporting year. However, the emissions from natural gas and electricity usage at Core Metric Sites are calculated and monitored on a monthly basis through the use of utility bills and are continuously validated and updated throughout the reporting year. The emissions factors for these energy sources are validated at least annually and updated when appropriate following guidance from the World Resources Institute GHG Protocol.

<Sect><H2>Sustainable Fix Keeps 52 Miles<Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 of Nylon Out of Landfill</H2>
<P>At the Boeing EnCore Interiors (BEI) facility in Seal Beach, California, technicians noticed <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 a sticky situation on the shop floor: During 737 floor panel fabrication, the double-sided tape used to create a vacuum seal during <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
curing was difficult to work with and  damaging tooling.</P>
<P>The materials used in the process were also single use, so over 11,000 rolls of tape and 52 miles (84 kilometers) of nylon were making their way to the landfill each year.</P>
<P>“We knew we needed to find a solution <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 that was better for our tooling and the environment,” said David Brink, General Manager of the facility. </P>
<P>Alongside Boeing Research &amp; Technology, <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 the BEI team researched, tested and implemented a new design with a reusable <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
silicone bag and nonadhesive zipper seal  that doesn’t damage tooling.</P>
<P>The sustainable solution keeps 8.7 tons (7.9 tonnes) of waste out of the landfill and saves an estimated $175,000 annually in material costs. There are also ergonomic benefits, <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 as technicians no longer have to peel the double-sided tape off the tooling.</P>
<P>“Oftentimes a new project improves one <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 area at the sacrifice of another for the greater good,” Brink said. “Implementing the reusable bag was a win on all fronts: financially, ergonomically and environmentally.” </P>
<P>BEI is a Boeing subsidiary that supplies cabin products for new production and retrofit on Boeing and non-Boeing airplanes.</P>

 Energy and Water Use </H2>
<P>Boeing celebrated Earth Day on April 22 by kicking off its Battle of the Buildings (BoB) competition, an annual event since 2018. BoB engages employees to conserve resources at manufacturing and office <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 work sites. </P>
<P>In 2021, employees at 163 sites in 39 countries participated by taking over 72,000 60-second actions to benefit the environment over a month. Boeing Munich emerged as <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 the winner.</P>
<P>“The Battle of the Buildings really speaks to what so many of our employees care about,” said Maria Bethke, conservation team lead <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 in Munich. “We were able to reduce waste and conserve energy by taking small yet meaningful, steps.”</P>
<P>Top 60-second actions included turning off lights, HVAC, electronics and equipment; sorting waste properly; refusing to use single-use plastic; and picking up foreign object debris and litter onsite. Conservation leaders used Boeing’s production system boards to engage manufacturing employees.</P>
<P>Other Boeing sites that excelled in the competition included employees from St. Louis; Mesa, Arizona; San Antonio, the Spares Distribution Center in Seattle and Boeing Distribution in Melbourne, Australia.</P>
<P>Conservation Manager Crystal Frost adapted the program from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), after Boeing participated in a 90-day pilot in 2016 and reduced energy use by 26 percent in <Span ActualText="

 several Renton, Washington, buildings.</P>
</Sect>
<Sect><H2>Giving Protected Species Safe Passage Over 10-Lane Highway </H2>
<P>As part of our commitment to sustainability — with a focus on environmental stewardship and biodiversity — Boeing donated $1 million to the National Wildlife Federation in February 2022 for the Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing in Los Angeles. </P>
<P>The crossing, with ceremonial groundbreaking in April 2022, will span 10 lanes of U.S. Highway 101 to reconnect an integral wildlife zone near Boeing’s Santa Susana Field Laboratory. The wildlife crossing will be critical to saving the threatened local mountain lion population from extinction.  Boeing has a history of partnership with the National Wildlife Federation, including donations for the wildlife crossing campaign, a long-term mountain lion study in <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 the Santa Monica Mountains and educational outreach.</P>
<P>“We thank Boeing for their long-term partnership and support in helping to make this project a reality, as well <Span ActualText="

 as for their donations to our important community-based work, like Wildlife 2 Watts and building schoolyard habitats,” said Dirk Sellers, Chief Development Officer, National Wildlife Federation.</P>
</Sect>
<Sect><H2>Championing This Idea: ‘Commit to Do What You Can’</H2>
<P>Environmental scientist Kristin Marshall is Boeing’s 2021 Environment Champion, an annual award given to an employee who exemplifies leadership by improving <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 environmental performance and inspiring others to do the same.</P>
<P>Throughout her career, Marshall has been inspired by one of President Theodore Roosevelt’s favorite sayings: “Do what you can, with what you’ve got, where you are.” She encourages everyone at Boeing to act <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 to ensure environmental sustainability.</P>
<P>Some examples of Marshall’s environmental commitment include leading the installation <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 of an award-winning rain garden and working with a team to implement automated environmental monitoring at paint booths. </P>
<P>“Many of the sustainability and environmental challenges we face are definitely huge in scale, but everyone at Boeing can — and should — contribute to the solution,” Marshall said. “You can figure out what single action you are going to take with the options you have and take action today, tomorrow and <Span ActualText="

 in the future.”</P>
<P><Span>Shining a Focus on Safety, </Span>
<Span ActualText="

<Span>Sustainability and Clean Tools</Span>
</P>
<P>In 2021, motivated teams of engineers and technical experts advanced the safety and sustainability of automated laser tool cleaning, earning a Boeing Technical Replication<Span ActualText="

 Award for their efforts. Employees at Boeing Auburn in Washington pioneered the work, while the Composite Wing Center in Everett, Washington, advanced the concept and colleagues at Boeing Canada Winnipeg expanded it even further.</P>
<P>Conventional tool cleaning uses manual sanders or chemical processing, which adds ergonomic, safety and environmental concerns. Laser ablation nearly eliminates those risks. The teams’ solution has the following benefits:</P>
<P><Span>• </Span>

 and other facilities net-zero emissions, specifically Boeing-controlled emissions and business travel. The company is continuously increasing renewable energy use, conserving resources and using carefully selected offsets to sustain this achievement.</P>
<P>Boeing chooses offsets that meet rigorous requirements set by Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), American Carbon Registry or Gold Standard. Many projects leverage the power of nature and are designed for the protection and restoration of forests. Boeing looks for “co-benefits” or the positive effects that a policy or measure aimed at one objective might have on other objectives. For example, forest health may be the main objective, and while other benefits extend to supporting local communities and protecting biodiversity. </P>
<P>Since 2020, Boeing has been an official partner of the Aviation Carbon Exchange (ACE), a partnership between the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and XCHG company, CBL Markets. ACE is a centralized marketplace for airlines and other stakeholders to buy offsets eligible for the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). </P>

<TD><P>Boeing takes a risk-based approach to managing the security of its data and has a documented low-risk appetite for cybersecurity and <Span ActualText="

 data protection. This approach starts early in the development life cycle and is supported by a partnership between IT and various functions with responsibility for data protection regulations and intellectual property protection. In benchmarking against industry, Boeing has found that <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
its cross-functional approach to data protection is unique and provides a comprehensive view of data security risks throughout the life cycle <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 of information. Data is classified by sensitivity and the protective controls required for each sensitivity level are documented, implemented  and audited on a regular basis. Regular reviews of systems are meant to ensure that the appropriate controls are in place and provide opportunities to evaluate risk as change occurs in the operational and cyber environments. If an issue or data security risk is identified, there are clear reporting channels and remediation timelines established based on system and data criticality. Corrective Action Plans are put in place and monitored to completion. Strong partnerships between IT and Boeing Legal ensure that issues are addressed in a timely manner and reporting of incidents to the appropriate regulatory bodies occurs as required.</P>

</TD>
<TD><P>Product Security Engineering provides a disciplined approach to the development and sustainment of our products, which is essential to ensuring mission assurance/resiliency and security. Security is integrated into our engineering processes starting from concept development, ensuring that we develop products that are secure by design. Key cyber attributes and adversity (or threat) to the system are identified during requirements engineering, allocated throughout design, implemented and validated during development, fully tested, and supported during sustainment. Additionally, Boeing works to ensure that our products are designed to anticipate, withstand, recover, and adapt to cyber <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
 attack. Specifically, our internal design practices have high-level requirements to baseline and monitor data flow and system behavior, detect <Span ActualText="
"> </Span>
anomalies, and actively manage system configuration. The ability of our systems to understand normal operations and rapidly detect and  mitigate abnormalities, combined with the security engineering focus of our development processes, provides Boeing’s programs with a proactive approach to risk management. Product Security is also integrated into the Boeing enterprise Incident Response process. We work seamlessly with stakeholders to rapidly identify, analyze and mitigate vulnerabilities and breaches across our portfolio.</P>

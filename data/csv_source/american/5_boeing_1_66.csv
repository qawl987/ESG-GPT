through collaboration with our stakeholders we learned a lot in2021 and we see exciting opportunity going forward while we still have more to learn the following are a few reflections on the journey
aerospace has always been about efficiency and has competed on innovation and fuel efficiency to meet customers expectations climate change and de carbon izing aerospace have further increased the urgency for progress airlines defense customers leasing companies and governments around the globe are aligning to bold climate change ambitions we support the commercial aviation industry s ambition to achieve netzero carbon emissions by 2050boeings strategy to de carbon ize aviation is focused
aerospace plays a profound role in our world and enables societal benefits aerospace connects and protects and while the covid19 pandemic challenged the industry it also reminded us of our industry s value people all over the world yearned to be connected to others and global air transport delivered necessary products and goods to peoples doorsteps billions of passengers fly every year to connect with loved ones explore new places and understand cultures engage in commerce and care for those in need dave mentioned the industry s vision for sustainable growth by2050 which will require us to work learn and solve challenges together to create future opportunities for passengers workers and economies at
to explore and mature sustainable solutions we must continue to work together with partners across our communities our industry academia governments and nongovernmental organizations and philanthropic foundations given each
boeing also participated in cop26 where the world convened to discuss climate change across all industries and on a global scale there the world economic forum in partnership with us special presidential
going forward we will remain focused on employee wellbeing and safety global aviation safety equity diversity and inclusion sustainable operations innovation and clean tech and global community engagement among many other important elements
as we look to the future of flight aerospace innovation is energized by how to de carbon ize the industry boeings strategy is focused
these are ambitious challenges throughout our industry and our company history we
in that spirit we are on a journey to solve sustainable aerospace challenges together we appreciate our stakeholders partnership for shared successes as we move forward

efficiency is a founding principle for the mq25stingraytheyousnavys first un crewed aerial refuel er instead of diverting fa18 super hornets from their fighter mission to refuel other carrier aircraft the mq25 with its highly efficient commercial engine and lightweight composite skins will be able to stay in the air much longer using little fuel itself to complete its mission
efficiency is part of the mission but it is also part of our design and production philosophy said jim young boeing mq25chiefengineermq25 is a digitally native aircraft with 3d models of every structure and system even their performance is modeled which helps predict operations and sustainment
using the models and validating them over more than 120 flight test hours and three refueling flights has accelerated our confidence in this design and helped us identify improvements much earlier than traditional programs said young
the efficiency thread continues through mq25 production where advanced manufacturing techniques eliminate the need for drilling during aircraft assembly
as a result our mechanics are holding digital tablets not drills that guide the assembly process young said it is not only safer and more ergonomic but also helps increase quality and reduce foreign object debris it is all part of supporting the navy sair wing of the future
